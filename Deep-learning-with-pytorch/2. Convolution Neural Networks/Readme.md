## MLPs v/s CNNs
| MLP                             | CNN                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Only use fully-connected layers | Makes use of fully as well as sparsely connected layers |
| Only accepts vector as input    | Also accepts matrices as input                          |



### MLPs 
In a MLP, every hidden node needs to be connected to every pixel in input image. This accounts for a lot of redundancy.<br>
