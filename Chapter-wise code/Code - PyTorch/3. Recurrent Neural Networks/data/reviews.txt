bromwell high is a cartoon comedy . it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life  such as  teachers  . my   years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high  s satire is much closer to reality than is  teachers  . the scramble to survive financially  the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers  pomp  the pettiness of the whole situation  all remind me of the schools i knew and their students . when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school  i immediately recalled . . . . . . . . . at . . . . . . . . . . high . a classic line inspector i  m here to sack one of your teachers . student welcome to bromwell high . i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched . what a pity that it isn  t   
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig . starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy . a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane  violent mob by the crazy chantings of it  s singers . unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting . even those from the era should be turned off . the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader . on a technical level it  s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond . future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly .  
homelessness  or houselessness as george carlin stated  has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school  work  or vote for the matter . most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism  the war on iraq  pressuring kids to succeed  technology  the elections  inflation  or worrying if they  ll be next to end up on the streets .  br    br   but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home  the entertainment sets  a bathroom  pictures on the wall  a computer  and everything you once treasure to see what it  s like to be homeless  that is goddard bolt  s lesson .  br    br   mel brooks  who directs  who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival  jeffery tambor  to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds  he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings . the bet  s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can  t step off the sidewalk . he  s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it  s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly  lesley ann warren  an ex  dancer who got divorce before losing her home  and her pals sailor  howard morris  and fumes  teddy wilson  who are already used to the streets . they  re survivors . bolt isn  t . he  s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it  s fight or flight  kill or be killed .  br    br   while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn  t necessary to plot  i found  life stinks  to be one of mel brooks  observant films where prior to being a comedy  it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles  young frankenstein  or spaceballs for the matter  to show what it  s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don  t know what to do with their money . maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money .  br    br   or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .  
airport    starts as a brand new luxury    plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens  james stewart  who is flying them  a bunch of vip  s to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum  also on board is stevens daughter julie  kathleen quinlan   her son . the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid  air the plane is hi  jacked by the co  pilot chambers  robert foxworth   his two accomplice  s banker  monte markham   wilson  michael pataki  who knock the passengers  crew out with sleeping gas  they plan to steal the valuable cargo  land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean  loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle . with air in short supply  water leaking in  having flown over    miles off course the problems mount for the survivor  s as they await help with time fast running out . . .  br    br   also known under the slightly different tile airport     this second sequel to the smash  hit disaster thriller airport       was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like it  s predecessors i can  t say airport    is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best  just . it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid  air hi  jacking  then the crashing  didn  t he see the oil rig    sinking of the     maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure         submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside  either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the    floods or if any of the doors are opened  it  s a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character  s  dull dialogue  lethargic set  pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for    odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  there  s not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . even when the navy become involved things don  t pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but there  s just something lacking here . george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background .  br    br   the home video  theatrical version of airport    run    minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence  many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni  flashbacks to flesh out character  s  longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport    . as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices  i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren  t great either . along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award  s hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that  s a little harsh . the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately  the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly .  br    br   the production values are alright if nothing spectacular . the acting isn  t great  two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this  one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail  also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too .  br    br   airport    is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly  the production  bland direction doesn  t help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldn  t be this boring or lethargic . followed by the concorde . . . airport          .  
brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren . best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none . the corn on face is a classic  as good as anything in blazing saddles . the take on lawyers is also superb . after being accused of being a turncoat  selling out his boss  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  i  m a lawyer  he says . three funny words . jeffrey tambor  a favorite from the later larry sanders show  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto . his character is more malevolent than usual . the hospital scene  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site  are all  time classics . look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  one bleeds  . this movie gets better each time i see it  which is quite often  .  
this film lacked something i couldn  t put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress . this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man . even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play . it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors . i just don  t know .  br    br   but could it have been the screenplay  just exactly who was the chef in love with  he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant  and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits  than of anybody or anything else . he never convinced me he was in love with the princess .  br    br   i was disappointed in this movie . but  don  t forget it was nominated for an oscar  so judge for yourself .  
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon . sure  its flawed . it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots  . many of the jokes fall flat . but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive . its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either . my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead  .  
sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch . although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch . the absence of a sound track was brutal . the loooonnnnng shots were too long . how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining . i really had a hard time just getting through this film . the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman . and i  m no fan f his either . i think anyone who says they enjoyed     hours of this is   well  lying .  
this is not the typical mel brooks film . it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable . leslie ann warren made the movie  she is such a fantastic  under  rated actress . there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more  and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so  but all in all  this is worth the price to rent and see it . the acting was good overall  brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience . again  warren was the best actor in the movie  but  fume  and  sailor  both played their parts well .  
when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors . it was one of many movies i watched with my parents  but this was the only one we walked out of . since then i had never seen interiors until just recently  and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it . what a pretentious  ponderous  and painfully boring piece of    s wine and cheese tripe . woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career . in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman  allen gives us a dark  angular  muted  insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce  estrangement  career  love  non  love  halitosis  whatever . the film  intentionally  has no comic relief  no music  and is drenched in shadowy pathos . this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature  using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a  more pronounced depth of meaning and truth  . but woody allen is no ingmar bergman . the film is painfully slow and dull . but beyond that  i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters . instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling  whining  nicotine stained  martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity . amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room . everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes . everyone is  lost  and  struggling   desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them . it  s never about resolution  it  s only about interminable introspective babble . it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience  s ability to connect . woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out . and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining . i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance . i highly recommend this one if you  re feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death . otherwise  let  s just pretend this film never happened .  
this isn  t the comedic robin williams  nor is it the quirky  insane robin williams of recent thriller fame . this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over  dramatization  mixed with robin  s new love of the thriller . but this isn  t a thriller  per se . this is more a mystery  suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper .  br    br   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report  until william  s character gets close to achieving his goal .  br    br   i must say that i was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse . it felt more like i was watching a guy  williams   as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective . in other words  it felt real  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story .  br    br   all in all  it  s worth a watch  though it  s definitely not friday  saturday night fare .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  
  it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable .  and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman . and let  s not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen  s bergman pretensions  allen  s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding . what i don  t get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  ripping off  hitchcock in his suspense  horror films  in robin wood  s view  it  s a strange form of cultural snobbery . i would have to agree with that .  
yes its an art . . . to successfully make a slow paced thriller .  br    br   the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don  t even notice it happening .  br    br   fine performance by robin williams . the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film . however  the core plot is very engaging . the movie doesn  t rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering . the direction is good . use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good .  br    br   very nice  time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story   
the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than   years to make a  swedish  film  the first being susan sontag  s  brother carl   which was made in sweden  with swedish actors  no less   the results  oscar wilde said it best  in reference to dickens   the old curiosity shop    one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell .  pretty much the same thing here .  interiors  is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers .   i  m afraid of my anger .  looking into the middle distance  i don  t like who i  m becoming .   the directorial quotations  to use a polite term  from bergman are close to parody . the incredibly self  involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are  to the point of strangulation .   i read a poem of yours the other day . it was in  i don  t know  the new yorker .   oh . that was an old poem . i reworked it .   far from not caring about these people  however  i found them quite hilarious . much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen  s earlier films  only he  s directed his actors to play the lines straight . having not cast himself in the movie  he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics  intonations  and neurotic habits  turning her into an embarrassing surrogate  much like kenneth branagh in  celebrity   .  br    br   the basic plot  dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother  seems to be lifted more or less from bergman  s  winter light   the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst . it all comes through in the shopworn visual  aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper  the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach . etc  etc .  br    br   allen  s later  serious  films are less embarrassing  but also far less entertaining . i  ll take  interiors .  woody  s rarely made a funnier movie .  
in this  critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events  gabriel  robin williams   a celebrated writer and late  night talk show host  becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother  toni collette  . when troubling questions arise about this boy  s  story   however  gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret  according to film  s official synopsis .  br    br   you really should stop reading these comments  and watch the film now . . .  br    br   the  how did he lose his leg   ending  with ms . collette planning her new life  should be chopped off  and sent to  deleted scenes  land . it  s overkill . the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious  by the time mr . williams returns to new york . possibly  her blindness could be in question  but a revelation could have be made certain in either the  highway  or  video tape  scenes . the film would benefit from a re  editing  how about a  director  s cut    br    br   williams and bobby cannavale  as jess  don  t seem  initially  believable as a couple . a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage . otherwise  the cast is exemplary . williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization  and not a  gay impersonation  . sandra oh  as anna   joe morton  as ashe   and rory culkin  pete logand  are all perfect .  br    br   best of all  collette  s  donna  belongs in the creepy hall of fame . ms . oh is correct in saying collette might be   you know  like that guy from  psycho  .  there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women  due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly  they could have noticed collette with some award consideration . she is that good . and  director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock  he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful .  br    br   finally  writers stettner  armistead maupin  and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere .  br    br    the night listener          patrick stettner  robin williams  toni collette  sandra oh  rory culkin  
i don  t know who to blame  the timid writers or the clueless director . it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars  angie  charlie  denise  rosanna and jon  that there wasn  t enough left to really make a movie . this could have been very entertaining  but there was a veil of timidity  even cowardice  that hung over each scene . since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a    year  old woman and not angie harmon  why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world  if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead  this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn  t a five year old . what a waste  not just for the viewers but for the actors as well .  
the night listener           robin williams  toni collette  bobby cannavale  rory culkin  joe morton  sandra oh  john cullum  lisa emery  becky ann baker .  dir patrick stettner   br    br   hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand  out low  key performance .  br    br   what is it about celebrities and fans  what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm   br    br   in the latest derange fan scenario  based on true events no less  williams stars as a talk  radio personality named gabriel no one  who reads stories he  s penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand  culkin  who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one  s editor ashe  morton  who gives it to no one to read for himself .  br    br   no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna  collette giving an excellent performance  who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids . naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess  cannavale  whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete  s backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn  t anticipate .  br    br   written by armistead maupin  who co  wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film  s novice director stettner  and based on a true story about a fan  s hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot  boiler does . it helps that williams gives a stand  out  low  key performance as the conflicted good  hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him  the one thing that has escaped his own reality  and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core .  br    br   however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner  it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for .  
this film is mediocre at best . angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers . her bitchy demeanor from  law and order  carries over in a failed attempt at comedy . charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti  comedy . the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise  s marriage . hopefully that effort produces better results .  
you know  robin williams  god bless him  is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade  with perhaps the exception of  death to smoochy   which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic  . the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic  especially  insomnia  and  one hour photo  .  the night listener   despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release  is among his best work  period .  br    br   this is a very chilling story  even though it doesn  t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . in high school  i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson  who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result . i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist . when i saw this movie  the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind .  br    br   toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic  caretaker  . her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like  little miss sunshine  . there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me . it takes a good actress to play that sort of role  and it  s this understated  yet well reviewed  role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award  as of      . it  s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this  and it  s scary too .  br    br   this is a good  dark film that i highly recommend . be prepared to be unsettled  though  because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .  
the film is bad . there is no other way to say it . the story is weak and outdated  especially for this country . i don  t think most people know what a  walker  is or will really care . i felt as if i was watching a movie from the    s . the subject was just not believable for the year      even being set in dc . i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end . most didn  t stay for the qa either .  br    br   i don  t think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time . many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn  t know how to finish them . he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on . i really didn  t get woody  s  carter  private life or boyfriend either . what were all the  artistic  male bondage and torture pictures  from iraq prisons  about  what was he thinking  i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody  s character  car  . it didn  t work . it didn  t even seem to make sense really .  br    br   the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson . he played his character  car  flawlessly . you really did get a great sense of what a  walker  may have been like  say twenty years ago  . he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it .  br    br   as for lauren  lily and kristin . . . boring .  br    br   don  t see it  it is painful  unless you are a true harrelson fan .  
when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves . that being said  we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood . . .  br    br   writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded   br    br   with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life  jess  and the world around him  donna  .  br    br   as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably . the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward .  br    br   it  s to bad that most people will avoid this film . i only say that because the average american will probably think  robin williams in a serious role  that didn  t work before   please give this movie a chance  robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art .  br    br   oh and before i forget  i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in . he has the      s leading man looks and screen presence . it  s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now    br    br   s  
this film is one giant pant load . paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay . and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process .  br    br   the worst though is woody harrelson  whom i ordinarily like when he  s properly cast . he plays  the walker   a homosexual man in d . c . who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite . he couldn  t have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick . his  southern accent  is that  off the rack  version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers  as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has . it is monotonous . but  his is not the worst accent in the movie . his  boyfriend   played by moritz bleibtreau  attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him . he is incapable of rolling his r  s in spite of the fact that in real life he is german  and speaks several languages  one of them being italian  that  s kind of a good reason to cast someone else don  t ya think   br    br   from the story  to the screenplay  to the directing  to the camera work  to the performances by the leads  this movie is bad from beginning to end . the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin  lauren bacall  and kristin scott thomas . only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact . in fact  all three are excellent  in spite of being trapped in a really bad film . ufortunately  no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws . if you like these three actresses  watch them in something else . this movie is not worth your time .  
i liked the film . some of the action scenes were very interesting  tense and well done . i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it . a very tense action scene that seemed well done .  br    br   some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography  unusual colors  or interesting angles . also the film is funny is several parts . i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too . i  d give the film an  out of   .  
the plot for descent  if it actually can be called a plot  has two noteworthy events . one near the beginning  one at the end . together these events make up maybe   of the total movie time . everything  and i mean  everything   in between is basically the director  s desperate effort to fill in the minutes . i like disturbing movies  i like dark movies and i don  t get troubled by gritty scenes  but if you expect me to sit through   minutes of hazy  dark  literally  scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming . rosario dawson  one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here . and no  she doesn  t get naked  not even in the nc    version  which i saw .  br    br   if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch  descent   take a nap instead  you  ll probably have more interesting dreams .  
there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times . constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis  have kept psychologists  counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades . occasionally  some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence . that is the premise of the film entitled  the night listner .  it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon  robin williams  who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles . perhaps its because his show is losing it  s authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself . feeling abandoned by both his lover jess  bobby cannavale  and his and best friend  joe morton   he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation . it is here  a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help . noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a   year old boy called peter  rory culkin  . in reading the boy  s harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents  noon is captivated and wants to help . however  things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en  wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare . this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d . logand  sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop  this might be comical . instead  this may prove to be one of william  s more serious performances .   
plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption  murder  power and the rest of thriller related topics . characters are interesting though sometimes . not realistic but interesting nevertheless .  br    br   development is slow like tea drinking ceremony . visuals not stunning  but good enough to ease the eye strain . good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed  nothing shocking too much  nothing overexciting . movie sitcom style .  br    br   i liked woody  excellent performance . had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good . the rest are bearable though very predictable . the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows .  
i enjoyed the night listener very much . it  s one of the better movies of the summer .  br    br   robin williams gives one of his best performances . in fact  the entire cast was very good . all played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little . sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch . toni collette is great as the mom  and never goes over the top . everyone is very believable .  br    br   it  s a short movie  just under an hour and a half . i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version . i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie .  br    br   the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion  which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well .  br    br   do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads . it is not a hitchcockian thriller . see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well . if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed .  br    br   my only complaint with the movie was the ending . the director could have left a little more to the audience  s imagination  but this is a minor quibble .  
this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men  s wives .  br    br   i thought  the walker  would be thrilling and engaging  but i was so wrong . the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow  that even after   minutes of the film nothing happens much . seriously  the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes . that  s how slow it is .  br    br   the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom . it  s almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion . maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class   br    br   it  s sad that  the walker  becomes such a boring mess  despite such a strong cast . blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing .  
the night listener is probably not one of william  s best roles  but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie . i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before . some people maybe won  t like the slow pacing of this movie  but i think it  s the great plus of the movie . it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year     . it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content  dramatic feeling . this is no americanized movie . neither is it a predictable movie . you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be . this is no excellent movie that has everything  but hell  it  s a damn good and very original movie .  
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years . not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom .  br    br   the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not  nothing is of any interest . the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful  i just sat in utter amazement during this movie  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining  br    br   the producers of this movie were very clever . they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast . people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think  woody harrison  kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie .  boy are they in for a horrible time   br    br   if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning  
like one of the previous commenters said  this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery . such a waste because collette  s performance was eerie and williams was believable . i just kept waiting for it to get better . i don  t think it was bad editing or needed another director  it could have just been the film . it came across as a canadian movie  something like the first few seasons of x  files . not cheap  just hokey . also  it needed a little more suspense . something that makes you jump off your seat . the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax . i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the  reality  of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy . this movie needs to have a director  s cut that tries to fix these problems .  
a worn  out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case  the equally worn  out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out .  br    br   with such an outstanding case  one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins . but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity  no character arcs  and inexplicable behavior .  br    br   the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary   or on the other hand  completely unexplored . it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers . when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture   br    br   a regrettably dreadful movie . when will lauren bacall pick a good one  i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas . this one is definitely one to miss .  
the night listener held my attention  with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a   year old boy  rory culkin  who is very ill . williams has never met the boy in person  as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone . however  williams  ex  boyfriend  nice job from bobby cannavale  raises doubt about the boy  which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person . what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect . i will leave it at that . toni collette also stars .  br    br   i enjoyed this film  with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin  s adoptive mother . sandra oh also starred as williams  friend . the night listener is inspired by actual events  and it has a somber  almost creepy silence throughout . at times it is predictable  no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic  but i liked it anyway . i enjoy williams in roles like this  more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me . recommended .      
i saw this movie at a drive  in in     . until  howard the duck  i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen . this movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy  horror  teenage angst  and the hot rod that must have sired  my mother  the car .  maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it  s time .  
popular radio storyteller gabriel no one  robin williams  scraggy and speaking in hushed  hypnotic tones  becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen  year  old boy from wisconsin named pete logand  rory culkin   who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents . to boot  pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still  since his partner jess  bobby cannavale  good  happens to be a survivor of hiv himself .  br    br   he also acquaints himself with pete  s guardian  a woman named donna  toni collette  brilliant   and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin  he discovers some secrets he was  naturally  not prepared to find .  br    br   based on real events that happened to armistead maupin  who co  wrote the screenplay with terry anderson  and directed by patrick stetner  this film moves a lot faster    min .  maybe a few minutes longer  than one might think a movie of this genre would run . that  s good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear . it  s bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn  t sew  up any of the plot openings or back  story . i  d rather not go into any great detail except to say that  if you are not familiar with mr . maupin  s works or his personal story  you feel a little bit out of the loop here . still  the performances by williams  i would  ve loved to heard more of his narration  personally   collette  cannavale  culkin and much of the supporting cast  the waitress at the restaurant collete  s donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has   are top  notch and the mood established here   namely  the chilly  lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york   give a terrific framing for this story . it may have ends that don  t tie together particularly well  but it  s still a compelling enough story to stick with .  
ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical      s teens in turmoil movie . it is not a horror or science fiction movie . plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their  hot rod  club because they cannot meet the rent . once kicked out  they decide to try an old haunted house . the only saving grace for the film is that the  ghost   paul blaisdell in the she creature suit  turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell .  
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing . the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about . however  there is not much tension  and williams  mild mannered portrayal doesn  t do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy .  br    br   collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear . the production felt rushed and holes are apparent . it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort . the book is probably better .  br    br   one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .  
  ghost of dragstrip hollow  was one of the many    s movies about hot  rodding teens encountering the supernatural . in this case  the teens can  t pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted . with nowhere else to go  they decide on an apparently haunted house . as you may have guessed  once they arrive  some weird things start happening . and there  s a twist at the end .  br    br   there  s nothing in this movie that you haven  t seen in other movies  but it  s nice entertainment nonetheless . my favorite character was the foul  mouthed parrot . well  let me rephrase that he didn  t talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie  but he said things that we don  t expect out of a bird . the movie  s pure hokum  but harmless .  
i absolutely loved this film  i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it . i was completely enthralled through every second   br    br   i found the story gripping  the acting intense  and the direction spot  on . i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie . even though there was nothing  scary  about the story itself  i was soundly on edge through the whole movie  and for the rest of my evening .  br    br   i found that there were so many perfect choices made . . . the casting  the script  the little bits of humor sprinkled in it . there were so many points where the film could  ve gone for the cheap thrill  but it never did  and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately . . . and for the last number of years .  
  ghost of dragstrip hollow  appears to take place in a spotless netherworld  an era long gone by  where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket . it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival  who pressures her into a car race . that  s about it for the drag  racing   this b  flick is mostly concerned with rock  n roll  man  the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent  square teens who liked to party and yet didn  t mind an adult chaperone . there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges  necking kid  we thought we  d come out for some fresh air  . . . dad  where did you think you  d find it  down her throat     but the ghost is a little late in arriving . brief at   minutes  the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off  screen and a pre   scooby doo   styled unmasking which makes no sense . however  for nostalgia buffs  some mindless fun .  from   
this night listener is better than people are generally saying . it has weaknesses  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis  no doubt  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this . the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  this happened to a friend of a friend of mine  ghost stories . one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate . everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility  and real life just sort of plods alongno  so there are no flashy endings or earth  shattering revelations  no  showdown  scenes . thank heaven . you have to get into the zone when watching this movie  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  conventionally  good movie . williams isn  t terrific  but he easily meets the needs of the story  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic   no one   as he is the everyman  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story . toni collette  s performance should be nominated for an oscar  even if she maybe shouldn  t win it  . give it a shot . for quality and content alone  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days .  
the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful . it  s a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil .  
when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky  and i  ll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong . while every movie has its flaws  the night listener had an exceptionally low count .  br    br   if you read the last review  it was hard  since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie   you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done . unfortunately  if you read more than  lines into that same review  you discovered the poster  s reason for disdain he  she does not like the fact that the director is gay  or that the production team smokes crack . . . apparently  .  br    br   so  despite the fact that i have never written a review before  i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits  not the sexual orientation of its director . let  s go over a quick checklist first  . great plot  absolutely . i won  t give a shred of it away  but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials . this is a thriller  not a horror  and it should be approached as such . the story really will amaze you  even more so because it  s true  and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events  .  br    br    . wonderful acting  oh yes . robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type  cast  and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago . he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener  playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of . . . well  i  ll let you see for yourself .  br    br    . excellent direction  certainly . now  unlike the other poster to which i referred  i actually know something about direction . i  ve been sutdying the art of direction at school now for  years . of course i really don  t think that makes a lick of difference  the only thing that matters is if you like the direction   but i thought i should simply establish once again that i  m basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant . . . for example not the sexual orientation of the director  or the alleged drug habits of the production team  lol  .  br    br   patrick stettner  s direction was moody and dark  and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so  sought  after feelings of  tension and release  rather than the messy  fast  paced camera  work and quick cuts we  re so often subjected to today . some people can truly show you a story through their camera  while other  s feel as if they have to make the story with the camera . i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized  which is as an eyeball through which we all see .  br    br    . lighting  cinematography  and editing  great all around . i  ve already wrote so much  and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs  so i  ll just wrap it up .  br    br   in short  go see this movie . don  t listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it  especially if they  re so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive    of the way through their post . enjoy the show   ben

somewhat funny and well  paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless  fast  talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u . s . treasury agent  david morse  to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief  hacker  doug hutchinson   who stole forty  two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead .  br    br    bait  marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua   the replacement killers   and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn  t top his first movie . what the two films have in common is the action sequences  which are flat  out excellent .  br    br   foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning  but throughout the film  i began to catch on . hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in  marathon man  . morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost .  
i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments . it  s not a bad movie exactly  but it  s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre . plus  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways  and the characters  behavior often strains belief . i  d say its a film that you would get something out of if you don  t have a lot of film  tv  literature  life behind you  to be honest  i  ve seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even  . otherwise  its point has been made before and more artfully . and that gets to the big problem  which is that it really doesn  t have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point . it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling  and it doesn  t really pay off .  
the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico . this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch . karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval  an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty  greedy and backbiting no  count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will . pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life  sized toy people who populate the place . onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of  tintorera  infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character . the clunky  plodding  non  direction  trite by  the  numbers script  ugly  washed  out cinematography  ridiculous murder set pieces  a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon    overwrought string score  morbid gloom  doom atmosphere  largely lousy acting  karloff notably excepted   cheesy mild gore  poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm . a real campy hoot .  
vijay krishna acharya  s  tashan  is a over  hyped  stylized  product . sure its a one of the most stylish films  but when it comes to content  even the masses will reject this one . why  the films script is as amateur as a  year old baby . script is king  without a good script even the greatest director of all  time cannot do anything . tashan is produced by the most successful production banner  yash raj films  and mega stars appearing in it . but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland . thumbs down   br    br   performances anil kapoor  is a veteran actor . but how could he okay a role like this  akshay kumar is great actor  in fact he  s the sole saving grace . kareena kapoor has never looked so hot . she looks stunning and leaves you  all stand up . saif ali khan doesn  t get his due in here . sanjay mishra  manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted .  br    br    tashan  is a boring film . the films failure at the box office  should you keep away .  
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces   the fall of the house of usher    dance of death   poem   is actually quite creepy from beginning to end . it is similar to some of the old black  and  white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  for example   the cat and the canary    the old dark house    night of terror  and so on  . boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life  size dolls that terrorize the guests . he dies early in the film  or does he   and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences . i won  t go into too much detail here  but it is definitely a must  see for fans of old dark house mysteries .  br    br   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room .  br    br   dan basinger      
the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya . there is no story  no humor  no nothing  the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs  up advertisements stitched together . heavily influenced from the matrix and kung  fu hustle but very poorly executed .  br    br   i did not go a lot of expectations  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  what were these guys thinking      .  br    br   the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini .  br    br   the reason why i did not give a rating of    is that every time i think i have seen the worst  bollywood proves me wrong .  
aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the    s . also he declared that he had murdered another   people  he used to kill pregnant women  and then he set them on fire  .  br    br   this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts .  br    br    aro tolbukhin  is a serious work  so analytical  it  s not morbid at all . such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster .  br    br   my rate      
summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what  s the hottest movie of the week  given   .   of the screens dedicated to screening it . ok  so i may exaggerate on the percentage  but you get my drift . besides stuff from hollywood  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters  and from some of the trailers shown  i  m hyped to watch them too . tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for      but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas . when i watched jodha akbar  it was a full house  but it wasn  t for tashan .  br    br   after watching it  i knew why . it was entertaining  but it was fundamentally weak . just like it  s literal english title  which means  style   tashan is all style  but little substance . not that it doesn  t have the usual star power  but scenes felt forced  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous  even for bollywood standards i must say . which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya  who wrote dhoom and dhoom   both of which i enjoyed tremendously .  br    br   in his rookie directorial outing with tashan  while you can  t fault his direction  you  d probably scratch your head over the plot  which was clunky at best . it tried to force too many things into the story  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation  but that came a little too late  and only toward the finale  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie  with hong kong  s wirework and hollywood  s ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil . and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing  and the one that took the cake  in a dhoom  homage  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere .  br    br   at best  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters . saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff  a call center executive who gives english tuition  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material . his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  kareena kapoor   who  s not exactly who she seems  the meek and sweet natured hottie . she engages jimmy  s services for her boss  mobster bhaiyyaji  anil kapoor   who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah  beng does it . and to complete the quartet  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji  s business .  br    br   so begins a road trip of sorts  with friends who turned enemies  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on . jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all  because he goes from zero to hero  executing moves that would shame rambo  in absolutely no time  which is quite out of character . kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee . every character has a backstory created  and i thought akshay kumar  s bachchan pandey was probably the best  the most touching and the most fun of the lot  even though his character seemed a lot like a non  green incredible hulk with his gravity  defying leaps and power packing punches . his wounds also heal automatically  which impressively puts wolverine to shame . and the best part is his theme song  which is damn alpha  male and played in ra  ra mode each time he takes on adversaries .  br    br   but sad to say  that  s the only tune that is memorable  something that cheers  bachchan  pandey  bachchan  pandey  . for most bollywood movies i watch  i will usually be able to  despite the obvious language gaps  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two . i wasn  t able to do that after tashan  because the songs unfortunately just weren  t catchy at all . usually the song  dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location . that i enjoy  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front .  br    br   tashan probably didn  t take itself too seriously  but coming from vijay krishna acharya  s story  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well . billed as a blockbuster  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one . despite akshay kumr stealing the show  tashan could have been better on the whole .  
after seeing several movies of villaronga  i had a pretty clear opinion about him   he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters  forgetting about a rhythm of the movie . that is why  though having good critics  his movies never caught the broad audience attention . in aro he follows the same line  but really improved on the rhythm  especially in the end of the movie . frankly speaking  i slept through the first part  cause though the first part gives necessary information  it is really slow . nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga .  br    br   recommended .  
shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards . i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction  plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can  throw away  crores on such stupidity . shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to . saif ali khan  completely disappointed in your choice of film . kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim  wit . anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english . his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last   minutes  it was enough to pop a blood vessel . don  t waste any brain cells  energy or your money to go see this  go see  rent amu  with konkana sensharma instead  a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india . intelligent  poignant and a wonderful story  tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making .  
there  s so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin . en la mente del asesino  inside the killer  s mind   that it  s very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning . let  s just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really  really great done . its made with super   black and white shots    milimeters  color  interviews  flashbacks . aro tolbukhin its like a movie made a documental or viceversa  which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering  did he really ever existed  the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala  worked in a religious mission and then killed some people . an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced . the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death . nowadays  some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character . the one we are witness of  the movie .  br    br   for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind  mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done . nevertheless  the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions  we clearly never justify them . so  the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro  s childhood  giving the movie such an incredible new force  even tough never got weak or boring  .  br    br   i don  t mean  and don  t want  to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you  believe me  the trip to see it is more than worthy .  
first lesson that some film makers  particularly those inspired by hollywood  need to know  just  style  does not sell . i guess tashan when translated will mean style . second  if you are hell bent on selling style  that does not spare you from having a decent story .  br    br   tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director . but it is not slick . for example  all three  saif  kareena and akshay  are narrators at different points in the story . but this setup is not utilized to properly . there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations . actions sequences are from the seventies .  br    br   cheoreography of the film is awful . i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film . vishal  shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film . why is there a sufi song  dil haara  in tashan  why is the cool hinglish song  dil dance maare  not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy   br    br   akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film . but he is in his stereotyped self . you won  t mind missing this film .  
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen . the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre . this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story . the casts is outstanding  including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before  ever . the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one . my one complaint  i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy  but other then that i think they did a great job . the dialog  the characters and the story was perfect . the acting was wonderful . this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci  fi channel . you heard me  the best movie to come out of the sci  fi channel . i give the fallen ones  out of   .  
if this is a     product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry  yash raj  then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards .  br    br   if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil  akshay  saif and kareena  then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film . the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar . he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations .  br    br   the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film . that itself was a clear indicator of the director  s vision . every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted . anil kapoor  s gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times . and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie .  br    br   in short it  s the biggest waste of resourses after  jhoom barabar jhoom  . i would say that even  aaja nachle  was a better enjoyable movie than this .  br    br   one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved . the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay  s love story . after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music . vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song . the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically . only one song  falak tak chal  is somehow good of all in the lot . an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar .  br    br   regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this  akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location  probably ladakh  . in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car . i am still thinking who wrote this .  br    br   if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts . you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god . are we still seeing a     movie with all these technical heights achieved  so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan .  br    br   dear anil kapoor  akshay kumar  if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out . as artists of such stature  you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers . people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively . i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie  the actors and the production house both .  
without kirsten miller this project needn  t have been completed . however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it . it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance . wagner  s dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing  but his few scenes didn  t detract from being entertained . mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line  the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster . the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable . she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be . i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost .  
i had some expectation for the movie  since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif . well  i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom   but if dhoom  is compared to tashan  i would say dhoom  is very realistic .  br    br   when i saw the credits at the beginning  i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way . well  the very first scene itself pised me off . then  the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences . me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights . it was like akshay against some   thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns  phew . . . you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are .  br    br   the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story . it reminded me of some of the early    s movies .  br    br   well  the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena  who looked really hot in this one . and for that  i give a rating of  out of   .  br    br   guys  please . . please . . . don  t see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie . well  you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes .  br    br   thats all .  
sure  titanic was a good movie  the first time you see it  but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change . the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love  story and think ooh  how romantic . the second time  and i am not the only one to think this  it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking  when is this dn ship going to sink    and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times . the acting in this film is not bad  but definetly not great either . was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film  i mean who does he think he is  anthony hopkins or denzel washington  he does  half  good movie and won  t do a film for less than    million . and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it . but enough about  in my eyes  the worst character of the film . kate winslet  s performance on the other hand was wonderful . i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together . there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love  stories as it is  filmmakers shouldn  t try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie    out of a possible     i give this film a mere    .  
the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar . akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in     neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman . it is hilarious . except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film . the story looks like the writer told his   yr old son to write . the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director . except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan . i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody .     is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero .  
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was . this is the only movie i think i would ever give a   star rating . i am sure this movie will always be in my top  .  br    br   the acting is superb . leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best . i don  t think anyone could have a better job than kate .  br    br   if it is a rainy day and you can  t decide what to rent  well  this is the one . you will love all the acting  special effects  and much much more .  br    br   if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now    you won  t regret it .  br    br    
i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film .  br    br   jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss  lakhan singh  english . the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can  t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh  who is also known as bhaiyyaji . but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji  lakhan singh is a don . in the meantime  bhaiyyaji hires a man  bachchan pandey  to track down jimmy and pooja .  br    br   starring saif ali khan  kareena kapoor  anil kapoor and akshaye kumar  the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra .  br    br    tashan  has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched . yes  the scenery is good and kareena kapoor  and her much publicised weight loss  looks good . but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other  hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production . with reference to songs  unfortunately  there is not one song that i can remember now .  br    br   there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well . but this cannot be said for anil kapoor  it did not suit him at all as a villain . lastly  never mind aditya chopra  who in the past has produced and directed good films such as  mohabbatein   what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie   br    br   conclusion bad movie  not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression .  
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather . titanic is the greatest movie of the   st century . with great acting  directing  effects  music and generally everything . this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn  t like it any more so most of the world decided to agree . there is nothing wrong with this movie . all i can say is that this movie  not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time  the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i  ve ever seen . apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time . the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton . these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron  s masterpiece titanic .  
i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted . so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom    and saif ali khan  s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback  .  br    br   after watching it  i understood that why their wasn  t a proper trailer because there wasn  t anything in the film to show . the story was extremely dum and even a   year old child can come up with a better story  line . there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it  s difficult to figure out that who is killing who . also the action was daft  unrealistic e . g .  man with a handgun managed to kill about    men with machine guns .  br    br   while i was watching tashan it reminded me of  films  br    br   sin city during the opening credits .  br    br   koyla anil kapoor  s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla .  br    br   jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny .  br    br   i also heard the budget is   crores which is the same amount as dhoom  and i don  t know where all the money went to . anyway if you did not like dhoom  then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan . race was hot on heels and that is a million times better .  br    br   the only  good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film  even anil kapoor  s terrible english couldn  t save this discomfiture .  
just two comments . . . . seven years apart  hardly evidence of the film  s relentless pulling  power  as has been mentioned  the low  budget telemovie status of   gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal . having said that however the thing is not without merit  either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se .  br    br   true  the plot at its most basic is a re  working of the amityville horror  only without much horror . more a case of intrigue  gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax  investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the  house  as the main suspect . the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard . it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments .  br    br   having picked the dvd up for a mere   .   last week at my regular video store  i cannot begrudge the expenditure .    .   would be an acceptable price for the film . just don  t expect fireworks   
i don  t want to go too far into detail  because i can  t really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film  but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie . the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring  pointless to extremely irritating . the humor was completely lost on the audience  and yes  ghost in the shell fans  this is not an action sci  fi or anything like that  its an attempt at slapstick comedy  and the humor just did not work after being translated . it was a total chore to watch this movie  and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest  especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything  i wasn  t expecting a ghost in the shell sequel  but i was expecting something entertaining  and it simply didn  t achieve this . yaaawwnnn . . . rent kino  s journey instead .  
what  s inexplicable  firstly  the hatred towards this movie . it may not be the greatest movie of all time  but gimme a break  it got   oscars for a reason  it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason . it  s a damn good movie . which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it . i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters . i  ve rewatched it on tv and video  and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen  twice  or maybe three times  actually  . but that might be it  the appeal of it . it  s a movie  yes  capital m there  it  s an epic  it  s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur . now  ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me  with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama . not that titanic has none of that . well  the acting was actually very good . the melodrama was quite heavy  handed at times .  br    br   but the reason titanic works is that it  s such an emotional ride . i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind  or give me a visual thrill . this movie isn  t exactly dumb  but it  s not cerebral at all . the visual thrills are simply means to an end  to fuel the emotions of the audience . i didn  t cry when bambi  s mom died  i don  t react to tearjerkers . but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million  an emotional rollercoaster that  if it were a regular one  would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl . and i  m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it  and have a ready supply of cynicism  then you can thoroughly dislike this movie . but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit  if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt  you  ll enjoy it completely . and look at the top ten grossing films of all time . is a single one of them bad  is a single one of them worth a score of  out of    no  not even the phantom menace . and this movie made  .  billion dollars worldwide . it can  t be bad . not possible .      .  br    br   p . s . how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman  spiderman was a fun movie  but it was a total     kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did . it simply wasn  t anything all that special . no one will remember it in   years . but i  m pretty sure titanic will be remembered .  
tashan  the title itself explains the nature of the movie .  br    br   this type of movies are actually made for flop . what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c  grade movies . or even some c  grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan . the much hyped and over  confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box  office which it certainly deserved .  br    br   in my view  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films  banner . how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi  s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last . the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences .  br    br   the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences  hearts . in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions . i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif   s hand instead of akshay . just from the starting point i expected of it  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth . saif is the main behind the whole adventure  while akshay joins in the midst . in any movie  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit . and tashan loses in this way  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit .  br    br   akshay  s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies . he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again . in between saif did a great job in race  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie . but he has fully developed himself in the acting field . and last but not the least about kareena . she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean . but i myself don  t think so  instead she became slim . yes slim    it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  or say  male  . beside them it is nice that saif  s son ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young saif . i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career .  br    br   those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood  or say want to be admitted in an asylum . thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films . in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of  years before going into practical directions .  br    br   sorry  i don  t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies .  
previously  i wrote that i loved  titanic   cried at its ending  many times over   and i  m a guy in his    s . i also wondered about why this great movie  which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics  was given only a  .  rating by imdb . com users .  br    br   well  i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . while   .   of all votes gave it a   rating    .   gave it a  rating . these   .   of these irrational imdb users  in effect  pulled the overall rating down to  .  .  br    br   in my previous comments  i blamed this very unusual voting pattern  a sudden surge in  ratings  with a high   rating  dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the  rating level  on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio . believe me  i  ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people  young men  mostly   who defame him left and right . they absolutely hate the man  and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  titanic  .  to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn  t like the movie that much  and gave it a  or a   etc . everyone has  and is entitled to  his  her own taste . but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only  .  overall for  titanic   pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous  ratings  is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture .   br    br   let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of  titanic  to  randomly chosen box office and critical  bombs   there are many more  but these  will prove my point  .  heaven  s gate        was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing  and imdb voters  ratings were   .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  big top pee  wee        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  cat people        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  blind date        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  jumpin  jack flash        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   . what do all of these films have in common with  titanic   all of the percentages of their  ratings are lower     than  titanic   and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award . again   titanic  got   .    ratings  compare that to the other  movies i just mentioned .  br    br   can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor   br    br    
i just saw the movie in theater . the movie has very few good points to talk about . kareena  s beauty and a couple of songs may be . thats it . the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas . anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed  even mumbai indians too  just now chennai has made it to semi  final  .  br    br   but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes . now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood . but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real . but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time . they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie . now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people . but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work . all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded . at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar . this is height of stupidity . audience is not paying to watch such stupidity . i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies . they cant make it . the last good action i have seen was from  ghatak  and  khiladiyon ka khialdi  . the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me . does these people see their movie after completion  can  t they figure out that the slow motion action  which is done using ropes  is too unrealistic and childish  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it . i just want to go back to amitabh  s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes . the sound effect was not very effective in those days  but visually it is much better than current era scenes .  br    br   this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors . please don  t make any more action movies  until you acquire the art of making it realistic .  
i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day . it was so touching and beautiful . i strongly recommend seeing for all . it  s a movie to watch with your family by far .  br    br   my mpaa rating pg    for thematic elements  prolonged scenes of disastor  nudity  sexuality and some language .  
the storyline was okay . akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie . kareena kapoor looked bad . there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner . i don  t know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role . there was nothing much to do for him in the movie . just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is . said ali khan was alright . i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot . what are we  fools     what do they think  they will show  men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them . is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals . . . . they take an entire squad of     policemen and no one was there to surround the palace . the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action . akshay kumar was between a circle of      policemen all shooting at him . . . . . and he shooting back at them . none of the policemen  s bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen . crap . crap .  br    br   i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement .  br    br   i strongly recommend not to see this movie .  
the movie titanic makes it much more then just a  night to remember .  it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten . why so criticised  i have no idea . could  will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it . could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece . it will be almost impossible .  br    br   the director no doubt had the major impact on the film . a simple disaster film  boring to watch  converted to an unbelievable romance . yes i  m not the romance type either  but that should not bother you  because you will never see a romance like this . guaranteed  everything to the amazing effects  to the music  to the sublime acting .  br    br   the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling . everything looks very real and live . the legend herself  titanic  is shown brilliantly in all classes  too looks  too accommodation . the acting was the real effect . dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles . no one could have done better . they are partly the reason why the film is so great .  br    br   i guess it  s not too much to talk about . the plot is simple  the acting is brilliant  based on a true story  probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears  thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten . well if you haven  t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical  and a film to idolise for hollywood . could it get better  no . not at all . the most moving film of all time  don  t listen to people  see for yourself then you will understand . a landmark .  don  t be surprised if you cry too   
i was very displeased with this move . everything was terrible from the start . the comedy was unhumorous  the action overdone  the songs unmelodious . even the storyline was weightless . from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom  i had high expectations . the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all . of course  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds . i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done . they tend to exaggerate way too much . in chinese films  this style works because that is their signature piece . but  hindi cinema  s signature are the songs . a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic . but  in the future  i  m sure these action movies will get much sharper . also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly . good luck next time .  
i had few problems with this film  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated . true  it is over three hours long  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly . i don  t think it is overrated at all  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent . the film looks sumptuous  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus . leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack  and kate winslet is lovely as rose . david warner  a great actor  steals every scene he  s in . the story is very rich in detail  and is hot on character development  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow . the last hour is extremely riveting  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat  when the titanic sank . i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving . the music score by james horner was lovely  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on . the     miniseries was good  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies . overall  i give titanic an  .     . bethany cox .  
if there is one film which is the worst of this year  it  s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom  style film  and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock  it was even worst then dhoom  and what i expected first saif  s introduction which is boring then saif  kareena meet  kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god  what he is doing in such a weird film  what kinda role it is  what acting is he doing  his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes  but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance  overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke  br    br   vijay krishna acharya would have got  films more to direct  if this film had worked  thats the strategy of yashraj  only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music  vishal shekhar  is ordinary  br    br   performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air  he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating  kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay  
i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies . anyway  everyone remembers the rms titanic . it was big  fast  and  unsinkable  . . . until april     . it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever . well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship . well  onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film .  br    br   so our two main characters are jack  leonardo dicaprio  and rose  kate winslet  . they  re not annoying too much but watch this and you  ll find out why they could become annoying  http   tinyurl . com  ojhoyn  . the main villain i guess is bad luck  fate  hand of god  no blasphemy intended   or just plain caledon hockley  billy zane  . combine all of the above and what do you get   oh yes  we get a love story on a sinking boat . the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite  mr . andrews  victor garber   idk he was so nice   lovejoy  david warner   murdoch  ewan stewart   lightoller  jonathan phillips   captain smith  bernard hill   molly brown  kathy bates   and many more . we also got the present day treasure hunter  brock lovett  bill paxton  . they add something to the story  something good . the action in here is awesome  especially in the second half  the drama as also good . in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears . the story is simple and it works . a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond . she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic . two lovers separated by social class and ultimately  the fate of the ship . everything about the story works and there are very few flaws . i give titanic  an    awesome  
absolutely awful movie . utter waste of time .  br    br   background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech . well if you really listen closely  whatever they speak is actually unintelligible .  br    br   camera work is bad  editing is not present  background score gives a headache  action is shoddy  dialogs are unintelligible  acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler  now she looks like a starved wrestler . hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace .  br    br   after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it  but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure .  br    br   please if you want to torture yourself  go ahead watch this .  
titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill  fated voyage on the unsinkable ship . writer  director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april        claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic . the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet . they make for a good on  screen couple . dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable . they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well . the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane  kathy bates  frances fisher  jonathan hyde  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film . the love story  the action  suspense  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time . the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation . the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it  s few flaws . titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it . the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg . overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill  fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch .  
sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie . . . i had had a trauma after watching welcome       and thought that they wont do it again . but after loads of amazing promos  tashan finally ended as heart attack .  br    br   such amazing  songs in promo  dil haara  chhaliya and tashan mein . . . . . and what u get in the movie  zero story  predictable plot  plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss . . .     br    br   music  wise another major disaster . . . in the music album  they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these  jokers and they haven  t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts . . .  that song is such nice  quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album       if you plan to watch this movie  i would say  watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like . . .  bachchan bachchan pandey . . .   br    br   overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english   br    br   go away man  i need to puke   
the ship may have sunk but the movie didn  t    director  james cameron  from  the terminator  did it again with this amazing picture . one of my favorite scenes is  the dinner table  scene  in which rose  s family and friends meet jack after he saves her . rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet  the one  . . . i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband .  br    br   jack and rose have a connection that is  movie stuff  but it  s good movie stuff . we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth . rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her . i really liked the hanging over the boat scene . it was a good risk .  br    br   the movie is long but it  s fantastic    good story  good flow  good actors    go see it twice if you want  its worth it     
i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent  the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest .  br    br   saif has over acted . kareena has improved her figure  but is not a good actress anyway . akshay is good . anil is also good . may i say the role wasn  t good . .  br    br   great deal of cheapness is filled in . wondered if that was supposed to be the  comedy part  of the movie . just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish  it has a history of so many good films .  br    br   overall  i was totally disappointed with the movie .  
titanic has to be one of my all  time favorite movies . it has its problems  what movies don  t  but still  it  s enjoyable .  br    br   when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic  i suppose my first reaction is  wait a minute  you don  t   i know so many people who don  t like this movie  and i  m not saying i don  t see why .  the love story is too cheesy  well  yes but isn  t it enjoyable and moving  all right  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic  everyone knows that love like this doesn  t actually exist . but this is a movie  doesn  t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while  the next complaint  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors . well  ok  in this movie  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials . however i think it  s unfair to say that they are terrible actors . i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in . but the roles they are given are simple  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected .  br    br   and finally  if one is going to complain that they don  t like this movie because they hate romance  or because they hate history  or tragic movies  then i  m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things . it  s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies . simply for being a movie  not because you dislike the genre  this is a good movie .  br    br   well deserving of its oscars  in particular  best cinematography  which i find to be the best i  ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy .  br    br   i know some of the writing fails  such as the constant screaming of each other  s names throughout the movie . the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times  but overall it  s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real  and the sinking feel so epic .  br    br   i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea  such as it being a love story  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed .  br    br   i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic  including memoirs form the day it happened  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults . the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper  not steel  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it .  br    br   i give this movie       not because i like romance movies  but simply because it  s an outstanding cinematic achievement  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events .  
the film lacks style  i mean original style . everything looks copied including action  first appearances in the movie  songs  dialog delivery  etc etc . yes  there the goof  ups were original  like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh . that was one in many goof  ups of the movie   anything good in the movie  yes  for kareena fans  if there are any  kareena in bikini . for akshay fans  his dialogs and action stunts . thats it . nothing else . so watch it on your own risk and don  t blame the director or actors . director is already insane and actors  i pity them .  
titanic is a classic . i was really surprised that this movie didn  t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings . maybe  it  s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something . when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters . when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month . it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason . some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd . many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to . and let  s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose . whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone  s imagination it was lovely . they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other . they trusted each other . they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money .  i  ll never let go  jack .  titanic is a great film down to it  s very core . it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers . it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .  
this movie is horrible . the acting is a waste basket . no crying  no action  hopeless songs . though the scenery is great . i have always wanted to go to greece .  br    br   anyway  as for saif  you  d expect a great performance  but even he let down the people .  br    br   akshay kumar  recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs . he was sensational in this movie . for only this performance  filmfare should introduce another award . the toiletries award for the worst performance . by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat .  br    br   kareena kapoor . she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma . in acting  in looks  or in body . she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her . she comes into this movie wearing bikini  s and tank tops and short shorts . i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife  to  be dress like that . but  she must  ve impressed some people dressing like that . and if you ask how  then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie . they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom . including me . personally i think that she dressed like a whore  but i really liked it .  br    br   i am forced to give it a      but i  d really give this movie a     . an unachieved film .  
another aussie masterpiece  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural  and it does very well . it doesn  t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks  it focuses more on emotional impact . a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co . bring to life . it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago . strange things begin to happen in the house  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared  who was actually a mass murderer . highly recommended .      
ok  i am not japanese . i do know a little about japanese culture  and a little less about japanese pop culture . other than that  i am spanish  i eat paella and i like black humor .  br    br   good  with that point set  i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences  mamoru oshii is quite a good director  despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head  and even that was curious and somehow interesting  and i am surprised he came up with this . it may just be one of those lost  in  translation cases  i am afraid it is  but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible . the jokes seemed bad  the script was overcooked  i mean  give the audience a break  and shut up a little you damn narrator  to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast  paced speaking and absurd action .  br    br   however  i thought the animation was really cool . the idea is great  and it is well exploited in those animated scenes . however  the eye  candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo  jumbo speech over still pictures . it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut  out hysterical characters scene .  br    br   i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this . the idea was good but horribly exploited . maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie  or maybe it will be more and more over  narrated scenes . but hell  if you thought talking head was dense  amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke .  br    br   of course  all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european . probably this is totally useless to japanese people  maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation . maybe .  
for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time . no exceptions . james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller . through films such as aliens  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science  fiction goes . he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film . but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance . the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows . the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful  interesting and entertaining film about it . the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren  t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  gloria stuart  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose  s and jack  s story alone  no one else . emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home . the music has become iconic and legendary . it is composer james horner  s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience . the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is . only one problem  the usual james cameron problem  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside . james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime . my heart won  t go on from this one .  
 . . . for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all cp must now be compared .  br    br   first off  the beginning did have elements of style . . . . and if handled well  could have become a cult classic  a  la pulp fiction or a desi desperado . . . but the plot  was there one   begins to meander and at one point completely loses it .  br    br   throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english  a call center smart alec  a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb  a levitating  gravity defying hit  man and a cop with a hundred  or was it a thousand  black cat commandos on their trail . . . . good ingredients in competent hands . but this is where i would like to ask the director sir  what were you smoking   br    br   im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making  for what must never be done  insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers .  br    br   possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music . . . watch the videos . . . hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed . vishal  shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes .  br    br   how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy . . . .  br    br   as i sign off  i want to really  badly know how does akshay  s bullet wound vanish in a microsecond . . . what were you editors doing  tashan  maybe . . .  
back in      do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research  the unfortunate death of princess diana  the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets . this was also the big year in the release of titanic  one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster . i don  t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans     of them being teenage girls  i was   years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times . it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful . at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn  t watch the film since i was    a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for  .   and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now . was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo  s real nose  ok  i know that  s silly to say  but i did re  watch the film . being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  best movie of all time  no  just depends on your idea of a good movie  but titanic delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage .  br    br   the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean . unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude  wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank .     year  old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing  and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing . she and her granddaughter elizabeth  lizzy  calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship . when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater . in      the upper  class    year  old rose boards the ship with her fianc  cal hockley and her mother  ruth dewitt bukater  both of whom stress the importance of rose  s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt  bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper  class  rose and her mother are financially broke . distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern . before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes . jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first  class formal dinner of the rapport  building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance  music and beer in third  class . but after cal  s servant informs him of rose  s whereabouts   rose is forbidden from seeing jack again . however  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven  year  old daughter to behave like a  proper lady  at tea  rose defies him and her mother  asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean  an engagement present from cal . after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time  they go to the deck of the ship .  br    br   they then witness the ship  s fatal collision with an iceberg . after overhearing the ship  s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is  rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal . meanwhile  cal discovers rose  s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe  so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack  s pocket . upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck  rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him . jack and rose return to the top deck . cal and jack  though enemies  both want rose safe  so they persuade her to board a lifeboat . but after realizing that she cannot leave jack  rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship  s first class staircase . jack and rose return to the top deck  the lifeboats have gone  and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down .  br    br   so does titanic live up to it  s hype  i still say that this is a great movie to watch  i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie . but it has great acting  amazing effects  a well  written story and still looks flawless . love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn  t get a lot of hype just because of leo  s baby face or kate  s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special . it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released . but all that aside  i do recommend this movie  it  s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day .  br    br         
the sight of kareena kapoor in a two  piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega  disappointing  mind  numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend . bad films are bad films and we see some every week  but tashan is not just a bad film  it  s a terrible film . terrible because it takes its audience for granted  terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they  ve got big movie stars onboard . written and directed by vijay krishna acharya  tashan is what you  d describe as a road movie  but one that  s going in all the wrong directions . saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff  a call  centre executive who  s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji  that  s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster  desperate to go cool . jimmy  s got his eye on pooja  the gangster  s pretty young assistant  played by kareena kapoor   who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of   crore rupees . determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja  bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job . so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey  the gangster  s faithful aide from kanpur  who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that  s hidden across the length and breadth of the country . much like those bad eighties potboilers  tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot . but the treatment  s so over  the  top  so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect . instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three  act structure  you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed . that garish item song in the desert  the bullet  dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort  kareeena  s bikini moment  even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks  a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala  and believe it or not  even a dhanno  style horse  driven tonga . in all fairness  not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture  because you  re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really . little do you expect in a seemingly fast  paced road movie  to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts . you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making . what  s more  i don  t think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance . arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work  tashan is like an overcooked stew . there are films that kill you softly  and then there  s tashan  a film that kills you with excess . packaged snazzily with glossy  finish camera  work  exotic locations and fancy costumes  every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together  but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn  t hold . borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn  t help either because they don  t blend with the film  s wafer  thin plot . one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging  but anil kapoor  s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists  and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly  unable to find his feet . kareena kapoor  meanwhile  queen of over  the  top delivery  does a decent job . but of course  if tashan is salvaged to some extent  it  s thanks to akshay kumar  s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character . you cringe when he  s cupping his crotch repeatedly  and you scowl when he delivers those double  meaning dialogues  but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he  s up there . despite some good music from vishal  shekhar  the songs seem like they  re only prolonging your misery . well that  s because tashan is a test of your patience . in case you didn  t know  tashan means style . i  m sorry to say  this film has none .

such a long awaited movie . . but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day . . from the trailers it looked like a action movie  but it turned out to be a out  out comedy  a bad comedy  . but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors  they  ve done their part of the movie very well . good acting  but i don  t think that can save the movie . . india has been shot beautifully . kerala  rajasthan   ladakh   were all saturated with color  alright . nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there     br    br   action sequences were shot very shabbily  no one could make out head  tail of the stunts  they  ve used akki  akshay kumar  very well but could  ve been done much much better . .  br    br   animation is the worst i  ve seen in recent movies     s movies had better animation scenes i guess  initial scene where the car is falling off  flying should be better word  the road into lake  .  br    br   and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every   to   mins  just to make sure audiences don  t forget the movie name i guess . .  
this movie re  wrote film history in every way . no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie  because it transcends criticism . every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it . it is an extremely beautiful movie  and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again . i  ve seen it more times than i care to count  and i still become transfixed every time  with a feeling which is hard to describe . one for the ages .  
i would have liked to write about the story  but there wasn  t any . i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but  hinglish  is only funny for like  minutes  after that its overkill . i would have liked to swoon over the  keep  u  guessing suspense  but it was as predictable as . . . um mm  a yash raj movie    . i would have liked to talk of the edge  of  the  seat action  but i don  t like cartoons much .  br    br   sigh  br    br   all in all  this movie is perfect for  . people attempting suicide  i promise it  ll push you over the edge  . sado  masochists  this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da  vinci code wore .  . people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism  i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone  . movie piraters more power to them . if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch  this is it .  . barnacles  most types of plankton  green algae  because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers . afterthought the director of the movie  obviously  is a species of his own .  and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind . . one is enough   br    br   things that could have made this a better movie  . a story  . a choreographer  . a screenplay writer  . a stunt coordinator  . a story  did i already say that    . a director  preferably one who is not mentally challenged  although even one who was challenged could have done a better job   . anil kapoorbubonic plague  avoid at all costs  . a statutory warning   watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health    br    br   things i liked about the movie  . kareena kapoor  for obvious reasons  . the english sub  titles   mera dil kho gaya  becomes   my heart is in a void    chaliya chaliya chaliya  turns into  im a flirt  im a lover  im a vagabond  . . priceless .  br    br   in short  tashan to me  is like the opposite of a rubrics cube  the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player  tashan promises to lower your iq  and that . . in a mere  .  hours  woot   br    br   sigh . . but thats just me . i could be wrong you  ve been warned anyways .  
titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic . the plot is simple  noncomplicated  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense . the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film  but the love story is an interesting one  however . kate winslett is wonderful as rose  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  billy zane  . early on the voyage rose meets jack  leonardo dicaprio   a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game . if he wants something  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries . the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes .  br    br   the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred . one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search . she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic . with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april        as all the passengers are boarding . after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york . historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson . captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned . smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty  two years of experience to stretch the titanic  s legs out to full speed . the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie . on april        at       an iceberg was sighted . they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film . the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate . the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until     when the lights finally failed . the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic  s many pleas for help . the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own . the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship . overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too . the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking . also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle . overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic .  br    br   many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship . the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose  s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time . yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer  thomas andrew the white star line representative  bruce ismay and all of the titanic  s officers were real . the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith  s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards . he had been a part of the white star line since     where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire  s captain when the titanic sunk . the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol . he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer  s former canadian hometown . as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower  class passengers from non  english speaking nations . in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted . the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss  . not wanting to leave her husband  s side mrs . strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic . furthermore  mr . goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best . the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat . in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water . her ticket on the titanic had cost over four  thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke . all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware . the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs . the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re  creation of the post  victorian era of     . the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women  s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet . women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do . the rich did not take well to new money  such as molly brown as depicted . everything of the time was very formal . women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes . smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie . men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes . women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society . although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross  referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken . the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking .  br    br   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise . the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people  s lives . everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night . in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic . only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored . this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed . however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed . there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed . as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter .  br    br   technically the film is very well done . to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie . in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean . cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the   years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship . furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage . this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner . at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film .  br    br   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic . like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn  t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture . certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing . if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this movie definitely is for you .  br    br    
this is the biggest flop of     . i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster . the songs have been added without situations  the story have been stretched to fill the  hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it  s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with    people . only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish . . . akki is also done a good job . . . . but the movieee just forget it .  
i find it so amazing that even after all these years  we are still talking about this movie  obviously this movie wasn  t that bad or else people wouldn  t even bother to talk about it . i personally enjoyed this film immensly  and still do  i guess this film isn  t for everyone  but it certainly did touch the hearts of many .  br    br   as for those that think that this film is  overrated  or  over  hyped  . . . well  we only have the movie  going public to thank for that  lol you see  it  s not critics  article writers that make a film  huge  or a  hit  with the general movie  going public . people make the film a huge success . with titanic  everyone was in awe . let  s face it  a film like this had never been made before . at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking . this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april     . even the silverware for goodness sakes matched   br    br   give this movie a break you guys  the critics thought this movie would sink big time  when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth  which is the best form of advertisement mind you  that this was a good  decent  movie worth seeing  then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie . . . not once  not twice  but maybe  times and more  so  i really wouldn  t say that this movie was  overhyped  . . . at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being  overhyped  . ha  critics didn  t even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron  s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film . however  the films money took care of that    million budget and much more   br    br   personally  i love this film . however  this film might not be for everyone . don  t say that this film sucks just because of romance though  that is the most sexist thing i  ve ever heard  disliking a movie just because it has romance in it  the story was sweet . the dialogue could have been better  but let  s face it . . . the real star of the movie wasn  t leo or kate . . . it was that gigantic ship  i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job . it  s not thier best work  i  ve seen much better work from both of them  but it wasn  t the worst i  ve seen on screen before . give them a break   br    br    
all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure  but this is not the case . vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor . she was unbearable throughout the film . her tom  boy look does not really goes well . even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all . everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin . the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie . anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not . akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif . the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed  
i avoided watching this film for the longest time . long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over  hyped  over  blown  overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz  and i wanted nothing to do with it . i never watched it in the theatre . i shook my head in disbelief at the   academy awards  even though i had never seen it . then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest . one of the girls spoke about this movie .  it was so great   she said .  you really felt like you were on the ship .   nonsense   i thought . i shared my feelings with my fellow judges . one looked at me and said   you might be right  but if she liked the movie that much maybe she  ll want to learn more about the real titanic . the movie must have done something right to get her so interested .   well  maybe   thought i . then it finally appeared on pay tv .  ok   i thought   i  ll give it a look see .  i didn  t want to like it  and i didn  t . i loved it  what a great movie .  br    br   where to start  first  the directing . my high school public speaking contestant was right . james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost  you are there  type of atmosphere . the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world . the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic . you don  t just watch it you really do feel it . then  the performances . the lead performances from kate winslet  as rose  and leonardo dicaprio  as jack  are excellent  winslet  s being the superior  i thought  but both were good . they had their rich girl  poor boy characters down to a perfect  t  i thought . in my opinion  though  stealing the show was frances fisher as rose  s mother . she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat  and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack . then  the details . i  m no expert on the sinking of the titanic  but i have a reasonable general knowledge  and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance . very impressive  indeed . then  the song . who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion  s performance of  my heart goes on .   br    br   problems . well  the romance was perhaps too contrived  in the sense that i just don  t accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class .  i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he  s been there for a while .  the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed  i thought  when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats .  br    br   a minor quibble  though . this is truly an excellent movie . my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre  where i think it would have been so much more impressive .  br    br        
i wasn  t terribly impressed with dante  s  st season offering in  homecoming   it wasn  t much of a horror story  but rather a smart political statement with the undead . screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men  s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women . the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists . then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home . i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak  but is unclear because this is never revisited . the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah . it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end . the worst episode . well  except for chocolate .  
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue  the budget  the this and the that . . . . who wants to hear it  if you missed the point of this beyond  beautiful movie  that  s your loss . the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think . i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life  and this one stands in its own entity  in my book . it was not supposed to be a documentary  or a completely factual account of what happened that night . it is the most amazing love story ever attempted . i know that it is the cynical    s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy  but come on . someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money  how lame is that  it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet  and is the top grossing film in the planet . i will gladly side with the majority this time around . okay  cynics  time to crawl back under your rock  i am done .  
i  ve now written reviews for several of the moh episodes  and this is among the worst . an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll . if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you   let  s check out the basement     then this is your show . except  it  s not amusing or entertaining  it  s just annoying .  br    br   the extent of the virus is never  ever showed . i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only  as the resulting situation is very  very frightening . but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home  and ultimately dies at his hands . the woman flees north  and runs into a few tens situations . then  some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her  things that make you go huh   . or something . then  she is huddling for warmth . the end .  br    br   awful . these directors are mailing this tripe in .  
every once in a while the conversation will turn to  favorite movies .  i  ll mention titanic  and at least a couple people will snicker . i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago  these same people were moved to tears by that very movie . and they  re too embarrassed now to admit it .  br    br   i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time . expecting to simply enjoy the story again  i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years . i cried again . . . . in all the same places . it brought me back to     when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time . a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall  yes  even more than star wars  . and today  many people won  t even admit they enjoyed it . folks  let  s get something straight   you don  t look cool when you badmouth this film . you look like an out of touch cynic .  br    br   no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults . some of the dialogue falls flat  and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly . however  none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film .  br    br   leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful . leo is one of the fine actors of his generation . wait  til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy . kate winslet was so strong in this film . the movie really was hers  and she held it together beautifully .  br    br   james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic . the sinking scenes were horrific  just as they were that night . how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me . i was utterly transfixed .  br    br   this film is one memorable scene after another . titanic leaving port in southampton . rose and jack at the bow   flying  .  iceberg  right ahead   the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean . the screams of the doomed after she went down . and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears .  br    br   the music  which has also been a victim of the film  s success  was a key ingredient . james horner  s score was simply perfect . and the love theme was beautiful and tragic . too bad celine dion  s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many .  br    br   i confess  i am a titanic buff . as such  i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it   in all its beauty . perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i  ve had such an interest in the ship all my life . however  i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs . i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy . the film was made with such humanity .  br    br   another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic  and you will not be disappointed .  
masters of horror the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population  when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god . scientist alan  jasn priestley  is brought in by the government  knows more than most  senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne  kerry norton  to take their teenage daughter amy  brenna o  brien   try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them . . .  br    br   this canadian american co  production was episode  from season  of the masters of horrror tv series  directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad . i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks  it takes itself far too seriously  i don  t really understand why it  s part of the masters of horror series  the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself  themes  ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it  s gets the chance during it  s short   odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up . i wasn  t happy with the inconsistencies with the story either  if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman  s neck on the plane  was he sexually aroused  i think not . why does every bloke then think he  s killing in the name of god  i just can  t see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible  starting to believe in god  i just found the notion ridiculous  the show also states clearly that there  s nothing religious about what  s going on so what  s the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see  then there  s the fact people get turned on by different things  what about gays for instance  will they kill guys instead of women  i know there  s a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it  s conveniently brushed to one side  then there  s the thing which annoyed me the most . the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho  killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened  it just felt so stupid  the plotting is rubbish  to round things off there  s a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the x  files            with a bright neon alien .  br    br   director dante on this showing definitely doesn  t qualify as a master of horror as far a i  m concerned  the story is badly paced  it  s just so stupid considering it  s played deadly straight  instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it  s deadly virus on the loose situation  the subsequent mother  daughter on the run because of it  there  s very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror  even less gore . there  s a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle  a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle  another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about .  br    br   technically like the other episodes it  s really good  it doesn  t have the look of a cheap tv series  the special effects are great as usual  it  s well made . the acting is alright but no  one really stood out .  br    br   the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode i  ve seen but bear in mind i haven  t seen all of them . . . yet . as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me  as a show made by a so  called master of horror it disappoints me even more .  
i am not a parent  neither am i a male . but i was able to identify with every character  s heartaches and pains .  br    br   this is a movie teenagers should watch . maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again . i  m sorry for those that don  t understand the value of love  family and friendship .  br    br   it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing . and it is great to see a   year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance . he showed at an early age  that he is capable of heartfelt drama . he should be offered more serious roles . note hollywoodland . . . his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in     .  br    br   this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages . maybe shouldn  t be watched by children under   because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families  but i recommend it to the entire family .  br    br   i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times . because it portrays the values that are important in life .  
i love the frequently misnomered  masters of horror  series . horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment . projects like this  and the similar  greenlight project  with gave us  feast   like it or lump it  are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror .  br    br   this one began with a kernel of really  kool  idea and ran . . . right off the edge of  where in the world am i going with this      .  br    br   i don  t know how to spoil the spoiled but  spoiler ahead  all of a sudden . . . no  there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier . . . we have long haired luminescent aliens  huh  . . . huh   brain drilling males and . . . yeah  i get it but . . . well . . . the worst curse of storytelling  a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement .  br    br   cue to storytellers . . . your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up . not the other way around . storytelling math    .  br    br   end of spoilers  big oops   
after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted  urban  turn of the century australian street  we meet julie  rebecca gibney  and peter  john adam  as they go out house hunting . they manage to get a loan for a fixer  upper on a posh sydney street  but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home . it just may be haunted .  br    br     gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker .  br    br   the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget  but not wholly excusable to that hurdle . a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film . the opening  thriller scene  features some wonky editing . freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there  s not much action . suspense should be created from staging  not fancy  fix it in the mix  techniques . there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location  the lighting  the fog and such  but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim  cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street  showing their increasing proximity . the tracking and the cuts need to be slow . the attack needed to be longer  clearer and better blocked . as it stands  the scene has a strong  made for television  feel  and a low budget one at that .  br    br   after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves . the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror        though the budget forces a much subtler approach . millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios  often dramatic in nature instead of special effects  oriented  such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron  which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall .  br    br   for some horror fans  the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama . at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in . but morphett writes fine  intelligent dialogue . the material is done well enough that it  s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later   especially if you  ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house .  br    br   once they get settled and things begin to get weirder  even though the special effects often leave much to be desired  the ideas are good . the performances help create tension . there isn  t an abundance of death and destruction in the film   there  s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares . but neither menace is really the point .  br    br   the point is human relationships . there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting . the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it . that it  s in a posh neighborhood  and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies  shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe  such as money or health problems . peter  s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with  normal  work  based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive  scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful . at the same time  we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be . julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown  but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship .  br    br   although   gantry row never quite transcends its made  for  television clunkiness  as a tv movie  this is a pretty good one  with admirable ambitions . anyone fond of haunted house films  psycho films or horror  thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy . it certainly isn  t worth spending    for a dvd  that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it  factoring in shipping and handling    but it  s worth a rental  and it  s definitely worth watching for free .

daniell steel  s daddy  what a refreshing story . this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children . how rare is that  in these times of  heather has two mommies   or what ever  you fill in the blanks  it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone . with the father  s roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga . how disappointing to have it end . every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role . i would have loved to see each character develop over the years . i loved this movie  it is one i will defiantly watch every time it  s on . good story  good acting  and i hope this isn  t a spoiler  but no obtrusive sex or bad language . yes it touched my heart . warning  get the kleenex ready . what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment  be it television or . movie  s . daniell if your listening  you go girl  give us more .  
a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante . their previous collaboration on the first season  s  homecoming  was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways . this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered . the supposed  payoff  showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing . if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial  cleaning  of the planet of it  s human infestation  why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion  why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king  s  the stand  instead of having the male population butcher the females  i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous . the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it . i like a lot of both dante and hamm  s work but this was just unwatchable .  
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about . love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about . one man  daddy  has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity . the kids grow up  one all be it  in the hard way  to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is  the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall . all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances . yes  i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent . this true to life is one which every young adult  and parent  would do well to see  although some will not realize it until they too are parents . a must see for those who care about their families .  
i gave this  stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned . from the domestic violence  to sexuality and many of the taboos therein . outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction .  br    br   it  s bleak  depressing and hopeless . while i don  t mind a less than cheery ending  i  m really very tired of the  humans suck  clich that  s central to every movie . i know you can  t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self  hatred as a member of the human race  but how  s  bout as a writer  director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil  right now  if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die  just go out  find a lake and swim  til your arms are tired . this way you won  t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive . it  s silly  not thoughtful  and boring .  
it  s heart  warming to see a movie that doesn  t bash males . in this one the wife  mother leaves her family to  get in touch  with herself  or pursue her libido . the father stays with and nurtures the kids  letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them .  
warner bros . made many potboilers in the     s and most of them are fast paced  economical and very entertaining . i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life . this is one of warner  s few hard  edged melodramas that simply doesn  t work . edward g . robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the    year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences . robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don  t cut the mustard . h . b . warner  aline macmahon and boris karloff are good  but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie . starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie . in addition  the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre  code hollywood . leroy  s direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations . sol polito  s camera work is strong . somehow  this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture  in a year that gave us  m    dracula  and  frankenstein   .  
i must admit  when i read the description of the genre on netflix as  steamy romance  i was a little bit skeptical .  steamy   in a movie from       i was prepared for disappointment . and when i realized it was shot entirely in black  white  i knew my erotic hopes were dashed .  br    br   boy  was i wrong  not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance   the discovery of first love  fear of the secret being found out  a sudden unexpected end   but at times this movie was downright erotic . you will soon forget that it is shot in black  white . the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years . and the performances from the two stars  essy persson and anna gael  are intense and memorable . ok  so they  re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls . it  s     . do you really expect teenagers from the    s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this  many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then . anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much .  br    br   i think this movie was way ahead of its time . the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination  opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown .  br    br   i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here . as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won  t be all you expect  i don  t think you  ll be too  too disappointed .  
a little girl  s dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification . when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other  it is assumed to be the body of a couple  s missing daughter . after this trauma  the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence . all of this changes when one day  many years later  she receives a phone call from her daughter  with the help of an ex  cop and a reporter  she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive .  los sin nombre  is a mess plot  wise  moves at an achingly slow pace  and is completely unscary . the saving grace is emma vilarasau  who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother . the best part of the movie is the ending  but i  m not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film . beware of the english subtitles on the recent r  release   they aren  t very accurate .  
this is a film . .  not porn .  br    br   this is a wonderful film    full of tender moments and memories   a beautiful piece of work    excellent    for intelligent  viewers only     br    br   if you are a film lover . a romantic . a person who has loved deeply  this is your film      br    br   it has a beautiful surreal quality . fine acting and directing . watching this film made me remember my first love .  br    br   thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life  love and the meaning of loss .  br    br   highly recommended for all film lovers .  
i  m not alone in admiring the first superman movie  a film that richard donner executed masterfully . i am also not alone in scorning richard lester  s superman  . . . which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie  sadly it is still an absolute abomination .  br    br   superman  s world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses  but superman  stretches things too far . it doesn  t matter who directed superman  because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader . in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do  unlike the original superman . with or without his powers  superman  s strength  or lack thereof  is handled in the least believable manner . there is too much to criticize  so i will not bother . i condemn this movie . . . perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on . super  duper bad .  
it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today  s standards  the film is interesting and provocative  br    br   therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl  s school therese is energetic  intelligent  and becomes a mentor for the innocent  naive  sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences  including a trip through an exclusive brothel  into her first lesbian liaison  and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience  br    br   the film does not exploit any sex  nor is there an abundance of nudity . . . the imagery is effective  but sometimes the camera lingers too long  and the story goes slowly  br    br   the director  radley metzger  went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories  good acting  and very high standards of cinematography . . .  br    br   artistically  however  this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment  whereas  therese and isabelle  was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism . . .  
i grew up on the  superman ii  theatrical version   s  t   and as a kid  i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three superman  type villains  it started off with a bang  the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes . kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen  as in part i . now as an adult  i can see how the mighty had fallen with s  t  see my review .  i  ve always heard of the back  story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original  s director  richard donner from part ii .  it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously  now it  s common  back to the future  and  matrix     for example .  unfortunately  after finally seeing the richard donner cut  or   s  rd   i still can  t fully recommend it . gone  was the great superman change scene  the entire paris rescue  as was the wonderful recap of part i in s  t  s opening . in fact  they all but wrote the words  previously on superman  in s  rd . the special effects weren  t great in either part i or s  t  but s  rd  they were mostly downright laughable  such as lois falling from the daily planet window . i will admit  some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures  such as any scene in the  honeymoon suite .  overall  if you grew up on s  t as i did  and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as i do as an adult  you should absolutely see s  rd as it  s almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes .  spoiler alert  unfortunately  the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s  t replaced with the exact same ending as  i .  this is not only a lazy  unoriginal copout  it doesn  t make sense on why clark would go back to that diner  if those events never actually happened . and will he continue to  turn back time  for every confrontation   
we watched this in my women  s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies  and i absolutely loved this movie . i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch . the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone . i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed . this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating . this is a movie i will show to my children . the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women  but this movie was more than that . it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite .  
so . . . we get so see added footage of brando . . . interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff . susannah york was hardly a slouch . new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn  t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets . real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that . . . let  s listen to donner make fun of lester  s version that made more logical sense . the president talks of the zod  defacing  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore . tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd . superman  s  freedom of the press  line sounded silly compared to  . . care to step outside  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark  s earlier scene in the truck stop . then there is the ending with the  turn back the world to go back in time  effect . it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack  n . j . ever went since it doesn  t free zod and company any more .  
i was going to bed with my gf last night  and while she was brushing her teeth  i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks . at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie  so i started watching it  and then it immediately captured me in  and i had to finish it .  br    br   the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble . she was such a great actor for being so little . maybe the fact it was in chinese  so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell . . . but she really seemed to be in character perfectly . i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her  boss  but everything just turned out rotten . lol . even when she brings him another grandson  just so he can pass on his art . . . it turns out that kid was kidnapped  so he gets arrested and has  days to live . lol . . . whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa  just backfires .  br    br   in the end  he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks . . . which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie .  br    br   definitely a gem  and totally original .  br    br   scott  
superman ii  the richard donner cut should be a fan  s dream come true . at long last  footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life . a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored . it seems like a winning situation . and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this  esoteric dream  is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence . while it  s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project . and it is only a very few times .  br    br   you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics . but then we start seeing new footage  alternates from superman  the movie for the trial  and that first bit of hesitation fades away . hey  this is pretty neat  things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project  and it doesn  t convince at all . and from this point on  it never ever lets up . it  s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects  but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was  you  ll believe a man can fly  it  s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here . the best effects in this are from the original productions .  br    br   another issue with this re  cut . a lot of it just doesn  t make sense . the only reason any of it really works is because we  ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii  a movie that does make sense . lester  s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly . part of this could be because donner didn  t get to complete shooting  the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible . what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent .  br    br   after viewing this  one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material  michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester . the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii . that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence  not ironically  both were filmed by donner . but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re  edited in such a hasty fashion  that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing . while lester honored the donner material  lester here is thrown under the bus .  br    br   so is there anything good in this release  well marlon brando is in it  and that  s neat to see . in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman  the movie . but that only highlights the problems of this release . any of the major scenes  really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando  would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section . instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances  many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used  sloppy edits and bad decisions .  br    br   watch the opening scene at the daily planet . why are we looking at jackie cooper  s back as he calls for lois and clark  at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on  i was initially confused by this  because i expected to see lois . the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this .  br    br   battle scenes are a mess too  with no geography between cuts . it  s just random action . of course  the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates . they should have used more of lester  s footage  but probably had too much pride to admit that .  br    br   the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well . as noted elsewhere  the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation  xk    while we all know it  s the  xk      a blind man in stm knows that  the producers of this assembly  who tried so hard to honor the original film  dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production . for all the supposed care that was put into this  the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable .  br    br   the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner  s didn  t make this a separate release here in the states . as it is  we  re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a  play all  option . it  s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes  but after that initial viewing  i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else . i know after my experience of watching this  i had new respect for lester  s version . it  s by no means perfect  but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief . he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so  while this new re  cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history .  
i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his  her reluctant guardian . i  ve seen enough of them  baby boom  kolya  about a boy  mostly martha  and to some extent  whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula . what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small  town china in the      s . extreme poverty was the norm  and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market . when wang discovers his purchased grandson  whom he  s nicknamed  doggie   is a granddaughter  he initially casts her out  even though she  s showed great promise as street  performing heir . even after he reluctantly takes her back  he  s not too upset when she  s kidnapped . the film is gritty then  showing the lengths to which a young  street  smart girl had to go to survive in that society .  br    br   the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context . in a western society  one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success . wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status  though  that i did  too . while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern  suburban child  it  s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage . and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her  her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense .  br    br   the peek at small  town life in a foreign country  the naturalness of the two lead actors  the surprising plot twists  and of course  the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film .  
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was . was the viewer supposed to learn something  or reflect on anything here  what was up with the pumpkins  was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots  does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel  why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews  it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery  . the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished .  br    br   i am truly amazed . i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community .  
this movie is the best film ever . i can  t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me . with a tear in my eye  i admire this movie . it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues  music  acting  story  plot . a story of friendship  courage  kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar . little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson . they were not conventional in real . every scene they were together was priceless . the camera work is flawless and grips you . the acting is inspired . xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks . renying zhou  doggie  looks pretty and played her character very well . zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great . he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well . if you have  t this movie  try it once  do watch it .  
i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina . instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family . and this went on and on . if mr . mcelwee  s family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr . mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco  related diseases . i grew up near the area where mr . mcelwee  s family began it tobacco business  i expected more than mcewee  s continual focus on his family . i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state  s economy by tighter regulation of tobacco . the countless references to the movie  bright leaves  are out of place  so what if gary cooper played mr . mcelwee  s great grandfather  does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film  i didn  t .  
verhoeven  s movie was utter and complete garbage . he  s a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed . by his own admission  he read  chapters of the book  got bored  and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch .  br    br   heinlein would have never supported that trash if he  d been alive to see it . it basically steals the name  mocks politics of the book  which is a good portion of it   and throws in some ta so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn  t get bored .  br    br   this anime isn  t perfect  but it  s at least mostly accurate  as best i can tell .  
when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don  t care what the movie is  edison started really good with some good effort from the singers  who  want  to  be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but . . .  in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience  done  a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action  done  and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie . . .  when you see   elite police officers  packed with weapons that can demolish a building  shoot at a guy behind a car  fail to hit him even once while he kills all  but   and then the guy takes out a flame thrower  to kill the rest    you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this   
wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a  king of masks  for his mastery of sichuan change art . liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person . liang is worried that a precious art shouldn  t die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang  s mind . the film is about prejudices  male domination  state of art  values and most importantly warmth .  br    br   i can  t recommend this film enough . the whole film is in loops . everything has a significance . its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just   minutes . a total satisfaction . for five minutes it is an artistic film  next five minutes its a sad film  next five minutes its a thriller . it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face . last scene on the rope is phenomenal . story and script is flawless . actors are brilliant . both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed . very impressive . it was not even nominated for oscars . that year  english patient  got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category  kolya  won .  kolya  was just ok and about  english patient  the lesser said the better . watch it     .  
the author sets out on a  journey of discovery  of his  roots  in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the  completely and deservedly forgotten  movie  bright leaf  is about an ancestor of his . its not  and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self  indulgent glorified home movie  suitable for screening at  the director  s  drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial  or even non  commercial release . a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios  because they are boring  irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his  her immediate circles . avoid at all costs   
one of the most heart  warming foreign films i  ve ever seen .  br    br   the young girl is an amazing talent . stellar performances by her  doggie   the old man  the king of masks   and liang  the living boddhisatva  .  br    br    spoiler  the deplorable treatment of children  especially females is disturbing .  br    br   loved the music . the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story .  br    br   this is a must see   enjoyable family film  although not for very young children . would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version .  
  the curse of frankenstein  sticks faithfully to mary shelley  s story for one word of the title  which wouldn  t be so bad if the changes were any good at all . the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein  s family has been completely excised and replaced with . . . nothing . the heart and moral centre of the story is gone . it doesn  t help that this frankenstein is a conniving  devious murderer he deserves everything he gets . the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clichs . even taken on its own terms  this is rubbish a bland  rambling film featuring a shite  looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . as it  s the first of hammer  s horror films  directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee  its place in horror history is secure . but it  s crap .  
wow . what a wonderful film . the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei  i hope he has more stories in him .  br    br   the acting is sublime . renying zhou as doggie was amazing   very natural talent  and xu zhu was a delight  very believable as the jaded old traditionalist .  br    br   the soundtrack was very effective  guiding without being overwhelming .  br    br   if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong  a family friendly  well acted  well written  well directed  near perfect gem .  
nintendo    you ers    how could you do this to me  i can  t believe it . . . this movie is actually worse than the first one . i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along . . . . oh god . . . where do i even begin  the plot sucked . the voice acting sucked . the animation sucked . the ending really sucked . if you liked this movie  you suck too . and to futuramafan      who said this was the greatest movie ever  you are a tool  plain and simple . this isn  t a movie for anyone but crack  addled ten  year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god . i  m still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie . . . . and then there was pikachu  s adventure . . . don  t even get me started on that horrible mess of a film . it is  in all truth  one of the most boring experiences of my entire life . don  t go watch this at any costs .  br    br   bottom line go out  find every copy of this movie that you can  and burn it . burn them all  and then proceed to rent a good movie  like aliens . . . or bowling for columbine . . . or even back to the future   
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic . i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the      s chinese  mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions  i felt i could get a real sense of the times  recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living . it seemed worthwhile to experience . the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true  to  form  both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect  perhaps the most effective that i  ve seen in chinese film . casting is great . images are memorable . acting is solid enough . thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression .  
now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have . wow some demented pokmon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this . animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pokmon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film . it is just an animation it should be on video .  br    br   ps i  ll give it a  because i just got  bucks i could not give it a half because there  s no halves .  
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship . set in     s china during a time of floods  we meet wang  an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him . when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang  he invites wang to join their troupe . however  we learn that wang  s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son . learning that wang is childless  wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever . taking the advice to heart  wang purchases an  year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son  doggie  the ancient art of silk masks . soon  wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art .  br    br   together  wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it . the story is absorbing . the setting is serene and the costuming simple . summarily  it is an international award winning art film which can  t help but to move and inspire .  
pokemon the movie was a terrible film . unlike the first one  this is not a good film at all . the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it . in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent . the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad . tracey really doesn  t have much to say or do  and unlike brock offers no comic relief . the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash  and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining . overall this film isn  t worth renting and the short movie before didn  t do anything for me or my wife . and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans . oh well  maybe the next one will be better . cant ge t much worse  
this is a superb movie  suitable for all but the very youngest  though accessibility for younger people was marred  at least in the print which i saw  by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub  titling  for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time  period it is set  there is no modern technology shown  not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle  just a drab  almost monochrome  everyday life  against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks . even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war  this could still be any time in the past    years .  br    br   but then we briefly see a motor car  late   s  early   s style  and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals  and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war  and the communist revolution .  br    br   which makes the central character  s desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant .  br    br   but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today  both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls  men and women the trade  for various purposes  in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship .  br    br   maybe i  m reading too much into this film but i don  t think so  i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom  whilst dross is passed off as quality material .  br    br   but don  t get me started on that . . .  
much worse than the original . it was actually painful to sit through  and it barely held my six year old  s interest .  br    br   introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting  but storyline is extra  thin  dialogue is still bad  and music is mediocre . watch the television show instead  it  s much better .  
king of masks  bian lian in china  is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film . winner of   awards from around the world  this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian  a street performer in     s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face  change opera . he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance  and no one knows how he does it . he has a longing desire to have a grandson  as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir . we then go to the streets  and see that people are selling their children because they can  t afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free  because daughters are not worth much in this society . wang bianlian  s story goes on from there .  br    br   the film was so astonishingly good  the acting was amazing  and the issues were so weighty and well  addressed . there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place  no one wants a little girl . also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman  and while he is famous and well  respected  he regards himself as something low  a half woman . as we go further into the film  the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it  the brutality and corruption of the military and police  and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  and xu zhu  the actor who plays wang bianlian  presents yet another beautiful performance .  
i recently watched this again and there  s another version which is shorter     . i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference .  br    br   one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with . ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice    br    br   prof ivy was rather boring . she sounded as if she was almost asleep  no expression at all with the few lines she had .  br    br   this was enjoyable enough but there wasn  t much to it at all .  br    br   a collector  whos after lugia  he has no plan to destroy the world  and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction .  br    br   the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better  deoxys  poke   is great  with no .  almost here .  
this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense . this is a wonderful film   deeply moving without being sentimental . highly recommended .  
i figured that it  s about time i let this one out . pokmon fans are suffering in america these days . why  because we rely on kids wb and  kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . as far as the series goes  they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television . so what is their problem when it comes to the movies  honestly now  i have seen all three pokmon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one . they are excellent movies . they are all enjoyable and fun to watch . and  after seeing pokmon     in theaters  i can  t help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts . the way it appears  it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here  in big bold faced letters . it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb  extreme sarcasm there  and created this crap .  br    br   possible spoilers from here on  br    br   well  i guess i should first talk about pikachu  s rescue adventure . my first gripe with this came with no narration . i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu  s vacation  and  instead of going with a caring  gentle woman  s voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai  they just cut the narration all together . this wouldn  t have been a problem  except for one thing . did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn  t let togepi go until the end  possibly the fans  but i  m sure not the parents . then  there  s the theme song . i couldn  t help but roll my eyes at this one . the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou  and was sung by japanese children . it was fun and enjoyable . this one nauseating . now  one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana . nice music  fun to watch . that  s changed with the bellossom . the music sucked for one  but on top of that  they had all the pokmon talk during the music  which turned out to be jumpy  annoying  and just unnecessary . oh  and then there  s the poliwhirl who thinks he  s a poliwrath . you  d think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . basically  not much could save this little ill fated dub  which is very unfortunate considering its potential . but  i haven  t touched on the worst of it yet .  br    br   you  d think that the warning signs would  ve been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power . for some unfathomable reason  i had been placing some faith in  kids and the wb . my thoughts were well  they screwed up on the first movie  but the second is different as far as the theme goes  so they should do well .  that in mind  i just didn  t pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said  you will believe that one person can make all the difference .  with the way they said that at every turn  i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version . then comes nintendo power  in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature  the power of one .  at that point  i became a bit more uneasy . the power of one    not a good sign . however  i still kept some of my false faith . big mistake .  br    br   sitting in the theater  i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . i can see a point in that since they didn  t pander this thing  repeating it over and over like in msb . however  it did more damage than anything else in this movie . first of all  the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash .  ah hah . so  ash is the chosen one  whatever . in the japanese version  the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . this time  he  s the chosen one . a greater way that this did damage was to lugia . lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokmon movie . . . . when the movie was about lugia . in this one  lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash . in the scene where they  re flying back to the main island  lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia  s existence  not that ash is going to make all the difference . overall in this category  ash wasn  t really the one person  that would make the difference  since he was helped by many along the way .  br    br   a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . furura  s flute song wasn  t nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one . jirarudan  s speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card   ugh . even worse  misty  s outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held . why didn  t you put them in pokballs when you caught them  this is like caging them to be displayed .  much different from whining about him thinking pokmon are things to be collected like stamps . if there were any real redeeming values in this  they came from team rocket . some pretty funny lines . not really to make me laugh out loud  but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . well  that was officially the last american pokmon movie i  m going to see . i  ve imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . i  ll be importing the fourth one as well . forget you  kids wb and  kids . you have forsaken me for the last time .  
this movie was excellent . a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes . this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie . you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way  doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions . this equals on big happy movie in the end . this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be  so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets . you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture . the cinema  photography is excellent  in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers . bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film .  
a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief  s daughter  leading to much hate and violence .  br    br   this crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at  though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level . the terrible costumes and the fact that all the indians are obviously white  makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it  s press materials pretends it to be .  br    br   in short  the plentiful nudity  the real reason for watching this  is good . everything else is not . there  s definitely better examples of both genres .  br    br   more interesting is that the ramrodder was filmed at the infamous spahn movie ranch and features not one  but two members of the manson family  catherine share and bobby beausoleil  who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda  stained screens of the pussycat theater   
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone  but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . women and performers  both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star  are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china . this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture .  br    br   the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors  performance .  br    br   a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .  
this is an awful film . yea the girls are pretty but its not very good . the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn  t get in the way . well  okay it might be interesting  but its not  because its so badly paced and and only partly acted . i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen  probably more laughable then they do on tv .  i won  t even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest . never read about that in the old west  this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward .  br    br   i like schlock films but this is ridiculous . there is a reason that i don  t go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good  the plot taking a back seat to breasts . the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats . the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent . the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level  infantile but harmlessly fun . something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie .  br    br   the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film .  br    br   i need not watch this again .  br    br   of interest to probably no one  the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil  a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped .  br    br   obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives .  
robert a . heinlein  s classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years  in everything to paul verhoeven  s     film to a tv series  to a number of games . but none of these  so to speak  has really captured the spirit of his novel . the games are usually unrelated  the tv series was more of a spin off  and the less said about verhoeven  s film  the better . little do most know  however  that in japan  an animated adaptation had already been done  released the year of heinlein  s death . and  believe it or not  despite its differences  this   part animated series is  plot  wise  the most faithful adaptation of heinlein  s classic .  br    br   the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons  something we were deprived of in verhoeven  s film . like the book  the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel  though we see a fair amount of each . while events happen differently than in the book  the feel of the book  s plot is present . rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement  but it  s only slightly more touched upon than in the book . while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book  it gets a bit of the anime treatment  but what did you expect    but it  s far superior to the film . heinlein  s political views are merely excised  as opposed to the film  where they are reversed . the big payoff of the series  however  is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs  aliens  which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version .  br    br   overall  i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein . and i think they did pretty well with this . if you can find this series  give it a look .  
ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names . i mean great actors like  the freeman aka morgan freeman  an asset to hollywood  however completely wasted in this film . then we got kevin spacey  who i  ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects . both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story . then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake . i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven  t hit him yet . well the reason for that  i might add  is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review . the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first   minutes of it . the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone . they got the one liners and sound  bite worthy stuff . the token troubled black guy  ll cool j  who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life . the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone . and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience . oh and lots of gun fire  i mean a whole lot . spoiler  not     the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who  s crooked dead and the hero prevails . they got flame throwers and rocket launchers  really no kidding .  br    br   bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors  or a great fan of justin timberlake  to all the   year old girls out there  enjoy   i wish i had more hands  because then i would have more thumbs  because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening .  br    br   may gd have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies . well it could be worst  another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher  hehe check out in the mix lol  or even get rich or die trying  . now the special thing about that movie is that its got    year old men  playing   or even younger teens . i could go on with these .  
as i was watching this film on video last night  i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure . i  ve a feeling i  ll be watching this again and again for years to come .  br    br   it  s got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story  film . and even though some cultural references are obscure for me  a western viewer  at the core this is a universal tale .  
roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look  alike  gambler man clint burns . george  gabby  hayes is mr . rogers  s ex  pal  sheriff gabby . gale storm  jane fillmore  and sally payne  polly morgan  are a noteworthy team  as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero .  br    br   of course  mistaken identity  impersonation is a plot development  since rogers essays a  dual role  . rogers is charming  as usual but  there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary  any potential to deliver a memorable jekyll  hyde performance is done in by poor material . the better pair to watch are ms . storm and ms . paye as the st . louis journal reporters  they are the film  s highlight . the songs are fine  though badly synched .  br    br    jesse james at bay       joseph kane  roy rogers  george  gabby  hayes  gale storm  
when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir  the aging and very proud street performer  known to all as  the king of masks   becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate .  br    br   his warmth and humanity  tho  find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china  s devastating natural disasters  in this case  massive flooding in the      s .  br    br   he takes his new   year old companion  onto his straw houseboat  to live with his prized and beautiful monkey   general   only to discover that the he  child is a she  child .  br    br   his life is instantly transformed  as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man .  br    br   there are many stories inside this one . . . many people are touched  and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe . thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama  and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye .  br    br   the technical transfer itself is not that great  as i found the sound levels all over the meter  and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie . highly recommended        stars .  
i saw this film at its premier at sundance   .  br    br   since american beauty is a movie that had something to say  i had hopes for towelhead . unfortunately  it was a disappointment . in fact  of countless movies i  ve seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals  towelhead is the only sundance movie i  ve ever wanted to walk out early from .  br    br   the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of  provocative  concepts concerning cultural stereotypes  rather than with an organic human drama . the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian . the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author  s political views . that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic . if there ever was a time when towelhead  s white male villains  condescending portrayals of blacks  ironic treatments of foreign cultures  etc .  were fresh  it  s long past .  br    br   for a more detailed review  please look up any of the many professional reviews available online . almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on .  br    br   on the other hand  the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled . as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites  you  ll frequently come across superlatives  stunning    breathtaking    profound    shocking   . . . it embarrasses me to read them  but it does not surprise me . indeed  i  ve encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial  cultural  gender  or sexual issues as deeply moving  thought provoking  full of profound insight . if you are such a person  by all means  rent towelhead and be moved by it . on the other hand  if you set your standards higher  you can safely pass on this one .  
an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film .  br    br   shameful since it warrants having a wider audience .  br    br   a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told  although admittedly predictable in its resolution . solidly acted by the principals . beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film .  br    br   my recent foray into chinese film  shower  the road home  not one less  has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring . china and its people is an amazing canvas for film  makers .  the king of masks  can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film .  br    br    
unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid  euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie . my points  br    br   film is based on  things  br    br     ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films  the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning  or  things about the asian culture . but unfortunately it is not enough . knowing kunefe and  names of other foods doesn  t make a person understand a culture . for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that . lebanese people are christian  ok they got that  and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries . the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don  t make ethnocentrism . so we don  t judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film .  br    br     sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this . show me   girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong .  br    br   i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre . please watch dr . strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor . a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it . where is the truth  where is the meaning about the movie .  
one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find  if you are lucky  in the video stores  is they are very accurate retellings of actual  true stories . farewell  my concubine  the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples . the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience   the hallmark of much hollywood  and especially disney films .  br    br   in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art . along an having lost his only son many years earlier  he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work . master wang is sold a son by a slave trader . all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art . but the son eventually is found out to be a girl . from there  the story get very interesting  with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera   a regional operatic style related to peking opera . fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang  s portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera . it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati  but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality .  
hollywood  s misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits . for every  godfather ii   there are dozens of  more american graffiti  s    stayin  alives   and  grease   s .  while the original  grease  is not a great film  the     adaptation of the long  running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the      s  energetic choreography  and an appealing cast . when paramount began work on a follow  up  the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster .  br    br   fortunately for moviegoers  michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts . her talent and beauty were already evident herein  and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform . maxwell caulfield  however  lacks even the skill to express embarrassment  and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic . what romantic interest  beyond hormones  could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield  that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory . only cameos by veterans such as eve arden  connie stevens  and sid caesar have any wit  although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material .  br    br   reviewers have complained that  because  grease   is always compared to the original  the movie comes up lacking . however  even taken on its own terms  the film is a clunker . after a frenetic opening number  which evidently exhausted the entire cast  the energy dissipates . with few exceptions  the original songs bear little resemblance to the early      s  and the only nostalgia evoked is for  our miss brooks  and  sid caesar  s comedy hour .  the jokes fall flat  and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite . however  worse films have been inflicted on audiences  and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters . unfortunately   grease   is not even unintentionally funny . instead  the film holds the viewer  s attention like a bad train wreck . just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered  the next scene plunges into even worse carnage .  
quote by nicolas martin  nicmart  from houston  tx  fine film  but dvd  reformatted for tv    april      this is a charming and emotive film . on the other hand  the dvd i purchased has been  reformatted to fit your tv  by the clods at columbia tristar . there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format  except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic  disposable trash that it is so used to producing . what a shame .   br    br   what a  criminal   shame indeed . however  there is another version out though . see here for details http   www . dvdbeaver . com  film  dvdcompare   kingofmasks . htm  br    br   wonderful performances by the two main actors  the king and doggie  btw .  
the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens  this one is a very bad copy . the change is only in the sex . in the first one the good one was sandy  here it  s michael . i prefer to watch the first grease .  
  masks  is a moving film that works on many levels . at its simplest  it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art  masks  to the next generation . although  at times the story makes the old man into a job  it is so well crafted  written  acted  directed  wonderful production values   it is easy to move beyond his plight . and  if you hang with it  the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting . kudos all around . this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults . the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it   
i  m sorry  but even tj hooker  s adrian zmed couldn  t save this sequel . i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original . then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene  notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs   and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious . i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang  having lost their  wheels  due to their gambling habits in the original grease  were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie . being shamed by that putz character carrington  i  d hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopeds   br    br   i also never bought the hackneyed theme hunky  australian  boy  can  t  fit  into  outsiders  dominated  school  ergo  goes  for  tough  guy  with  stupid  biker  helmet  look . it was disney story gone horribly awry .  br    br   so  it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble  gum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical . the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it .  
beautiful and touching movie . rich colors  great settings  good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while . i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china . my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too .  
the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student . although in the previous film olivia newton st . john  s foreign speech pattern is not explained  it  s explained here caulfield is her cousin . what  s conn still doing in school  i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she  s a beautician .  br    br   caulfield  s a smart kid  so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd . and that  s especially bad when zmed  s girl friend decides she likes caulfield . but being a nerd just isn  t going to cut it .  br    br   that  s when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act . he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride . he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face . if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards  caulfield won  t have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he  s outfitted .  br    br   grease  introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed . if you saw the first grease film  a much better film  than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out .  br    br   in addition to conn  eve arden  sid caesar  and dody goodman  all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles . the music score isn  t remotely as good as the songs that come from the original .  br    br   it  s not that grease  is bad  it  s just not all that great .  
this is probably my favorite movie of all time . it is perfection in its storytelling . it will break your heart not because it  s over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through . you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time .  
well  at least my theater group did  lol . so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl  while it was never my favorite musical or story  it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it  s still a lot of fun to watch . i heard horrible things about grease  and that  s why i decided to never watch it  but my boyfriend said that it really wasn  t all that bad and my friend agreed  so i decided to give it a shot  but i called them up and just laughed . first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn  t really clever  not to mention they just used the same characters  but with different names and actors . tell me  how did the pink ladies and t  birds continue years on after the former gangs left  not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy  gee  what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t  birds were just stupid and ridiculous .  br    br   another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn  t stopped . but when a new student who is sandy  s cousin comes into the scene  he is love struck by a pink lady  stephanie . but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t  birds  so the new student  decides to train as a t  bird to win her heart . so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t  bird  s butts . but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own  well  find out for yourself .  br    br   grease  is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn  t work . the gang didn  t click as well as the first grease did  not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable  because i thought that she graduated from rydell  but apparently she didn  t . the songs were not really that catchy i  m glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast  but that  s probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel  i wouldn  t really recommend this film  other than if you are curious  but i warned you  this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical .  br    br        
it  s a tale that could have taken place anywhere really  given the right circumstances . street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing . the aging entertainer finds  buys a male child to pass his art to . from there  we follow them through the rigors of their challenging  but free life along the river . traveling town to town  he performs and has some degree of notoriety . despite the times and the influences  the man is kind and good .  br    br   overall  the performances are first rate  especially xu zhu  who portrays the street performer . the child  renying zhou  is beautiful  and downright strong  and withstands the overt prejudices well . the two protagonists  along with supporting help from the kind opera singer  master liang  an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang   paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness  sadness and love . some have mentioned this film  s remote similarities to ba wang bie ji  farewell my concubine   yet this film can  t stand easily on its own  any resemblance is remote at best .  br    br   my only qualm with the king of masks  is the ending . it was weak  cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer . the audience was already wrapped up in the story  what was the needless manipulation for  what a shame . to bring a fine motion picture that far  only to surrender to emotional  and corny  pathos like that . it frankly made this film good  instead of the classic  it should  ve been . that aside  the king of masks is still very well worth your time . i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films . highly recommended .  
boy  girl love affair  sequel with songs  only this time she  s the punkette and he  s the straight arrow . movie  buffs out there actually like this movie  it has fans  i must say  the mind reels . . .  grease   is a truly lame enterprise that doesn  t even have the courage  moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames  like  jaws   or  exorcist ii   . no  it whimpers along in slow  motion and often just plays dead . it looks and feels cheap  with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling . this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and  although she doesn  t embarrass herself  it  s a role worth forgetting . a misfire on the lowest of levels . no stars from   
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the     s in this beautiful film . the story is simple . an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children . the faces of the actors are marvelous to see . the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well . the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine  which was more sophisticated and intricate . the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel . the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism  humanity  and history portrayed .  
when i was    grease  was like crack . it was a classless  shameful  euphoric  and powerfully addictive experience . my sister and i would watch it  rewind it  and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another . so  if you are an    year old girl  and you reviewed this film as  brilliant  or  fun  or  better than the original grease   you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass .  br    br   if  however  you are not a little girl  you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease  was anything but an inane  artless  slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production  distribution  and  or consumption .  br    br   for the sake of criticism  i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows  br    br    . in a well  executed musical  the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters . in grease   with a few debatable exceptions  to the music is obscenely pointless . most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way   score tonight    reproduction    do it for our country   and  prowlin    without making one concrete statement about any of the film  s characters or themes . plus  all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance .  br    br    . the t  birds should be badass  and if not at least somewhat likable  but instead each of them is an annoying wussy  dufus  loser . in the end  when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t  bird jacket and initiates him into the gang  michael should kick it to the ground  spit on it  and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it . but of course  he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads  there is no greater honor than to be one with the t  birds .  br    br    . since michael is beautiful  smart  kind  resourceful  and above average in everyway  his musical impotence notwithstanding   it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask . stephanie  on the other hand  is a slovenly  slack  jawed  bubble gum smacking  dirty sweatshirt wearing  gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat . so aside from being pretty  i guess   she harbors no likable characteristics  thus  audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael  s attraction to her .  br    br   i could go on and on  but i didn  t want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair . i will say this though  to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time  s sake grease  is an experience akin to re  living your first kiss . only you are   now and kissing a snot  nosed    year old kid with acne and slobby braces . the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed . trust me .  
ok  let  s get this clear . i  m really not into sci  fi  but for some reason i love stargate sg   .  br    br   jack o  neil takes his team sg   through a stargate . a round device that creates a wormhole . it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds . it might sound like your usual sci  fi  series  but it  s not  the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci  fi  series . i find that great . it gives you things  happenings and such you can relate to  and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets . they have some of course but thanks to o  neil who likes to keep a simple terminology  there  s not many .  br    br   the series has a nice blending of action  humor and drama . if you enjoy loads of special effects you  re not going to find it here . they don  t use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects .  
i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial  minutes of the film . i managed to stomach      minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead  which  by the way  is great fun  .  br    br   the story has massive holes in it . the plot line is hugely over stated and dull  the acting is awful  especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at  looking daft and singing like a castrato  . morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable  especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet . freeman and timberlake  s characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father  son relationship of sorts or something  which simply isn  t evident at all apart from the fact that though freeman  s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake  he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up .  br    br   it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line  which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion .  br    br   don  t watch this film  it is a pure waste of time .  
in the rapid economic development of      s in china  there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture  partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth  and more importantly  due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural  revolutionary era .  br    br   however  the resurgence of chinese traditional culture  namely  the confucianism  was not without disasters  because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part  and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example .  br    br   moreover  not only the part that should be discarded were inherited  the good part that was supposed to be inherited  such as the traditional opera  and its technique  such as changing face  was ignored in the resurgence  and facing extinction .  br    br   the director used this film to criticize the problem of re  embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie .  
i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love . it  s not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime . everything  s pretty restrained and you don  t really get an idea of who these characters are so  as a viewer  i wasn  t able to become emotionally invested in the storyline . i guess i  m not the target audience for this but i  m not sure who is . everything  s muted and soft focus and earth tones . . . nothing  s very interesting . i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it  s handled so discreetly that i was disappointed . rent personal best instead .  
this is a beautiful  rich  and very well  executed film with a rich and meaningful story . basically  it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a  male  heir to carry on his craft  but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male  dominated world . the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society  s traditional notions .  br    br   the story is fun  emotional  and complex . the exploration of the characters  their lives  and emotions  is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all . the film expertly conveys the old man  s emotions and his desire to find an heir  and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation . there is also humour  sometimes quite subtle  at appropriate points . the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture  creating further interest and depth to the film .  br    br   the directing  acting  and scenery are all outstanding . added to the other strengths  this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling  real characters . as a result  the film evokes strong empathy for  and feelings about  the characters .  br    br   some have claimed that the ending weakens the film  but i do not necessarily agree . perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending  but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small .  
i  ve read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained . this movie is nothing . it  s so badly written  directed and acted that it barely makes an impression . the characters speak in cliche  ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible . while that might make this campy and fun  it doesn  t because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull . it  s as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn  t allowed by studio execs to give the story some true  to  life gusto or didn  t have the cojones . this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard  issue bad lifetime tv movie .  
the movie is truly poignant  unique and uplifting . the story is universal in that it  s a battle between good  evil and the world between . the most important thing is that its rating is wrong  misleading  and a travesty . blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie . the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub  titles .  
i laughed all the way through this rotten movie . it  s so unbelievable . a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage  has a breakdown in front of a real estate office . what happens  the office manager comes outside and offers her a job    hilarious  next thing you know the two women are going at it . yep  they  re lesbians  nothing rings true in this  lifetime for women with nothing better to do  movie . clunky dialogue like  i don  t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn  t take it  doesn  t help . there  s a wealthy  distant mother who disapproves of her daughter  s new relationship . a sassy black maid  unbelievable that in the year      a film gets made in which there  s a sassy black maid . hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave . the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids . sheesh  no cliche is left unturned .  
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted  to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists . . . . . . and rightly so . this deserves a lot better treatment .  br    br   the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft  the rules of the day  and winds up with a little girl instead  not the conventional way  . . . . and the problems that ensue afterward . the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy  which he obviously thought was the case .  br    br   the old man  bianlian wang  xu zhu  is kind of funny  looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin . the little girl  doggie   zhou renying  is a cutie . the rest of the story is how the two manage after that . i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final   minutes .  br    br   overall  it  s involving story complete with drama  suspense  humor and sadness . just don  t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd . until it comes out on widescreen  rent it .  
they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love . the only thing worse is the film itself . the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital . at one point when the wife leaves the husband  a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack  no kidding . the actors try but are defeated by the inept  unbelievably terrible script . direction is staggeringly bad . no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation . how do things like this get made . i  m turning off the television before it  s over   
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen . it shows a china i had never seen or imagined  and i believe it shows      s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie . it is absolutely heart  breaking in so many situations  seeing how hard life was for the characters  and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful . you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film . the actors are all perfect  such that you feel like you have really entered a different world .  br    br   i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough . it may just change you forever once you have seen it .  
this movie was okay  but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are  born that way   especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman . it almost seems as if kate  s gender preferences turned on and off like a switch  making this film seem a little simplistic .  br    br   also  as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda  it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as  bigots .  and there was no happy medium . it was either kate  s friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her . this is not typical of interactions between gay and non  gay relatives and friends . it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play . it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make . sadly  the movie showed none of these types of interactions . for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance  it struck me as very intolerant movie  then at the end  kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory  is that what being gay is really all about  come on   
i just saw this movie today with my children  son    and daughter   .   at the  rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival . after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director  tian  ming wu . he  through a translator  told several stories about his life and the making of the film .  br    br   all tangents aside  both of my children really enjoyed this movie . of course  i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter  but much of the film is visually self  explanatory .  br    br   i won  t give anything away  but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than    of the hollywood crap  especially children  s films  out there .  br    br   cheers .  br    br   p . s . there is a  real   original king of masks who can  could do   masks at once . the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to  masks at a time  then they would cut and change to  new masks  .  
why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles   an unexpected love   ooh  how provocative    this much i know  would have been better . the film is nothing special . real people don  t really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed . the straight woman who  turns  lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character . if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion  you might enjoy this . although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn  t really get out in the world to observe people . why am i wasting my time writing about it   
this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows . it  s full of cliches  and the liz taylor character is not believable . it has a marvelous set  some exotic location footage . it shows taylor at the height of her beauty . she looks stunning .  
i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager . but i wanted to see it again  because traci lords is now earning a living as a  serious actor  . what the hell was going on in the eighties  this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors . definitely a waste of money .  
fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest   br    br   the sfx are very good for a movie of its age  and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors  even down to body type  a rarity in movies of this vintage .  br    br   a cozy movie  with splendid panoramas   even when chopped down to pan and scan .  
this is probably the first entry in the  lance o  leary  nurse keat  detective series in subsequent o  leary films  he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee .  br    br   a group of relatives  all played by well  known character actors  gathers in an old house  on a rainy nite  of course   to speak to a wealthy relative  who goes into a coma .  br    br   while they wait for him to recover  all sorts of mysterious goings  on happen  including a couple of murders .  br    br   a creepy film worth seeing   
elephant walk       starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god  forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen  staying out in the midday sun and going berserk . well eventually they do  after the typhoid or cholera outbreak  of course  and much mayhem ensues . taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler  adventure flick . when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps . thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day . one of my favorite guilty pleasures . in color too   
i am an actor  producer  director and what i am about to say are facts . this project was the worst film in movie making history . from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke . why would blockbuster released such crap  i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession . was the director trying to make a bad movie  i don  t think so . i seen bad zombie movies  but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table . this movie sucks    i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself  but please consider in taking up a different profession . i respect the fact that you completed a movie  but i have to ask you  were you smoking crack   i mean the makeup on your girls  the scary zombies  what were you thinking . to the whole nation  if i could have voted zero i would have . worst film in movie making history     
 . . . or type on a computer keyboard  they  d probably give this eponymous film a rating of    .  after all  no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt . to the contrary  the master of elephant walk  john wiley  peter finch   complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms   no matter how menacing   without a permit from the government  and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability  . furthermore  the elements conspire   in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic   to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people  as the natives dub them  to close the story . if you happen to see the current release earth  you  ll detect the elephant people are faring less well today .  
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he  s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .  br    br   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium . this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best  worst of ew . i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it .  br    br   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .  br    br   the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent . aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la . despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .  br    br   the sets are excruciatingly bad . the production designer  s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint  precinct     on a cardboard wall .  br    br   since the actors were obviously unpaid non  professionals   a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle  aged women   and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine  looking police uniforms . sadly  they couldn  t afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .  br    br   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he  s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .  br    br   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . don  t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommel  s logic and enjoy the absurd ride .  br    br   after much prolonged hand  clawing out of straw  covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make  up generously airbrushed around their eyes . looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .  br    br   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro  trash techno into the soundtrack . we  re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .  br    br   unlike other zombies  lommel  s girls speak and function as normal . . . er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified . this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . yes  a golden shower it is .  br    br   i won  t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . all i can say is it  s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . the spirit of ed wood lives on . . . or should i say his geist .  
i got in to this excellent program in about season  and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of  and   . it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after   seasons . sadly now the sci  fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a   season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more . atlantis is still going strong on its  th seasons . and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead . this tv show is a must see for all sci  fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it            
the plot of  edison  was decent  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen  and should face the same fate as the entire f . r . a . t . squad .  br    br   whether it was an emotional scene  an action scene  or even a silent scene  justin timberlake managed to ruin it .  br    br   do not waste your time watching this film . don  t even bother downloading it  midget porn would be a much better choice .  br    br   and justin  if you  re reading this  stick to music . even though you  re no good at that  you  ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .  
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue  but was pleased to find a fast  paced script  an underlying moral  excellent portrayals from all the actors  especially peter finch  amazing special effects  suspense  and beautiful cinematography   there  s even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban . not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic  before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work . all the supporting players round it out  and i do wonder who trained all those elephants .  br    br   speaking of the stone  buddha sequence  you really can discern that it  s vivien leigh in the long shots . her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor  s . the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots  where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk .  br    br   if you want a thought  provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring  spend a few hours with elephant walk .  
this movie is a joke . i mean a  ha ha  funny joke . why  because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical  inane plot and horrible acting . wow   br    br   within this movie there are so many unanswered questions . . . for example why do these women become zombies and how  why are there four black women who are zombie  s  caretakers  and what is their purpose  since when does  people make up a  nation  of zombies  and is smeared black eye mascara  scary  to anyone  anywhere  even a  year old   br    br   and lastly why was this movie made at all  why  why  why  no answer  that  s what i thought .  br    br   on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance  lol . at least they had the decency to do this much   
i watched  elephant walk  for the first time in about   years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior  rebecca .  as others have said  you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor  only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger  than  life yet deeply flawed relative . you have the stern and disapproving servant  a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart  climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead .  br    br   meanwhile   elephant walk  also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to  the letter   the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation .  br    br   maltin gives  elephant walk  just two stars  and imdb readers aren  t much kinder  but i enjoyed it despite its predictability . elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier  and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father . dana andrews   a favorite in  laura  and  the best year of our lives    is wasted as elizabeth  s frustrated admirer . the real star is the bungalow  one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history .  
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created . i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse . the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup . the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes . finally  there are maybe five or six zombies total  definitely not a nation . the best part of the movie  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished . again to reiterate other user comments  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie . also  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all . it is never explained .  
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser  known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon  current day sri lanka  . upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd . william dieterle  who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie  does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark  and almost eerie  undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i  ve seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery .  
seriously crappy movie .  br    br   first off  the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse  furniture store . the  bad  cop takes a girl  which they had pulled over  into the warehouse  s attic  while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there . the  bad  cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag  and the newbie cop doesn  t think there are any problems  but he still wonders what was in the bag  so he asks  gets a bullshit response  and then he thinks everything is ok  for now  .  br    br   the  bad  cop repeats this process  and even once with a tit scene  made it slightly better  . but eventually people start to catch on  which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was . one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies  like ya do . now  the  bad  cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch  and then he gets rid of the duffel  bagged body .  br    br   since she had the oogey  boogey magic put on her  she comes back with lots of eye  shadow on  which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie . . . also  the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become  eye  shadow monsters  . some of the girls meet up with a dude  who is apparently a currency specialist  and he offers them a ride  they look normal to him apparently  . but when the girls see other people  such as the one girls husband  he freaks out because she is hideous  some people freak out  but others don  t even notice  . . . . massive plot hole .  br    br   so  to wrap it up  the eye  shadow monsters kill the  bad  cop  who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene . it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel  like anyone would want to see part  of this cow dropping .  
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon . although based upon the book by robert standish  this initial set  up is highly reminiscent of hitchock  s  rebecca   with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and  almost immediately  her own husband  who is still under the thumb of his deceased  but  dominant father . taylor  a last  minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh  looks creamy  smooth in her high fashion wardrobe  and her performance is quite strong however  once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her  one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic  this feeling hampers the ending as well  . still  the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama  a bit of travelogue  interpretive dance  an elephant stampede  and a perfectly  timed outbreak of cholera   from   
i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie . it was so bad . i was totally fooled by the box art . don  t be fooled   its not worth your time i promise you . i don  t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what . i am so disappointed .    br    br   the description on the back of the box doesn  t even match  the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper . the synopsis on the back says she is only   . did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it   those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be . if anyone actually liked this flick then i  ve lost all faith in humanity .  br    br   and don  t even get me started on the story compared to the title . or the fact that the entire movie was done all in  locations . or that the cops didn  t even have close to real uniforms . why would i even say that   who cares about the cops uniforms   compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on .  br    br   this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans .  
elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film  but it is great entertainment in the quasi  melodramatic mode . it is the story of love  both genuine and illicit  as well as overweening ambition  devotion  and the arrogance of personal tyranny . a previous reviewer  john mankin  questions why the central focus of the film  the mansion called elephant walk  should have been built by the former owner  the  governor  the late tom wiley  right across the elephants  traditional path to the major source of water  the river . to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man . that his son  played by peter finch  should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father  is not unexpected  since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father  s rowdy  boys  club  as his role models . the point of the father was that he was a self  made man who would tame nature to his liking  and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated  but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd  and thus he would dominate his son and all around him  and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water . who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water  this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love  ceylon  today  s sri lanka  is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story  not just the expenses of miss taylor . were it not for this exotic location  much of the film was shot in ceylon   and the magnificent  bungalow  this would have been just another potboiler . one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place  as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant  conquerors  that were part and parcel of the british raj . it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony  teak  and marble . not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees  grille work window and doorway borders  evidently specified by art directors j . mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island . such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought .  br    br   for those immune to the blandishments of time  place  and architecture  there is always the allure of miss taylor  as she marries a man she doesn  t really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man  against the background described  and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased . as i said  it is not great literature nor even great film  but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today .  br    br   this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive  in  not on the home tv  so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera  work and scope .  
mt little sister and i are self  proclaimed horror movie buffs . we have seen just about everything  especially zombie flicks . now  we have seen a lot of good zombie movies  and a lot of bad ones . this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . not only was the acting horrible  but the special effects  graphics and ever  zombie  make  up was the worst i have seen . if you can even call it make  up  black eye shadow around the eyes  this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it  s cover . cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about . do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie                   i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying  this movie sucks  don  t waste your time  return now  hahahhaa i don  t want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie  i don  t even know how it got the ratings that it did  t should be in the negative  
my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old . i have never forgotten it . i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor .  she was twenty  two when she made elephant walk  remember  i  m nine  so the feelings aren  t sexual  i just couldn  t see anything else on the screen . i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her . she has begun to show her age   she  s almost seventy  four  but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived .  br    br   i have seen the movie several times since  and it is a sappy melodrama . what saves it is  of course  miss taylor  s beauty  magnificent scenery  the very impressive elephant stampede  and a well  made point on human arrogance in the face of nature .  br    br   all in all  a well  spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video .  
someone actually gave this movie  stars . there  s a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn  t spend   seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary .  br    br   this film is . . . well . . . i guess it  s pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn  snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits  apart from the acting  plot  story  sets  dialogue and sound  . i wrongly assumed it was about zombies .  br    br   watching it is actually quite scary in fairness you  re terrified someone will come over and you  ll never be able to describe what it is and they  ll go away thinking you  re a freak that watches home  made amateur torture videos or something along those lines .  br    br   i  m so taken aback i  m writing this review on my mobile so i don  t forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current  .  to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered .  br    br   i worst film i  ve ever seen and i can say  with hand on heart  it will never  never be topped .  
robert standish  s novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation . . . so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle  s film . . .  br    br   the story is about a rich powerful planter  peter finch   who brings a charming and tender beauty  elizabeth taylor   into the jungle as his bride . . . the plantation  of course  is endangered by some kind of wild life . . . for this reason taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere . . . the echo determination of a ghost  the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father  a highly dangerous disease  and the fury of wild animals . . .  br    br   in her confusion  boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face  a pretentious foreman  dana andrews   who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love . . .  br    br   with echoes of  jane eyre   the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master  and  rebecca   the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife   elephant walk  is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow  exotic dances with rage excessively colorful  stampeding big bull elephants  amazing mansion set on fire  all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent . . .  br    br   the movie gave liz a change of scenery  and allowed her more creative energy and self  respect than most of her other willful debutante  rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will  and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for  
this film has to be the worst i have ever seen . the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope . the story line of the film is laughable at best  with the acting so poor you just have to cringe . the title  zombie nation  implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total . this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy    s music when the zombies  attack  . the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video . if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so  then burn the copy .  
one of the first ova  s   original video animation   i ever bought  this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles . a cyberpunk sci  fi action comedy set against an unlikely  for a comedy  that is  background of near  future pollution in a dystopian society .  br    br   the  heroes  of dominion are the tank police  formed with a  if we can  t beat crime  we  ll get bigger guns  philosophy  and who are  like the name suggests  patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars  and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch . most  if not all  of these cops are borderline    psychopaths and neurotics  giving new meaning to the phrase  loose cannons  .  br    br   equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries  terrorist buaku and his hench  wo  men  the twin cat sisters  whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time .  br    br   the animation is not state of the art  but it  s very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion .  br    br   the english dubbing is  again  lots of fun . the soundtrack of the english version is also very good . i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that . . .  br    br   anyway  dominion tank police is great . it  s japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy  filled with completely over  the  top characters and situations  making sure that it never takes itself seriously . highly recommended .  
i stopped by bb and picked up  zombie flicks to watch over the weekend . now  i understand that the effects will be cheesy  the acting will be sub  par  and the sets will be suspect . so i  m not expecting much . but it should at least have a story . stories don  t cost a thing except time . . . . . apparently  they didn  t have any time either .  br    br    zombie nation  had  zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers . the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie . it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre .  br    br   the running time is only   minutes but it felt like  hours . according to my wife  who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room   it sounded like zombie porn . . . . which if you think about  sounds kinda gross . . . . . but it wasn  t even that good .  br    br   the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess .  br    br   it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off . i rated it a  out of   because imdb won  t allow me to use decimals .  
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt  one of the most amazing shows ever produced  but not just in the field of animation . while the first part  acts  and   mostly consists of action and fun  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  acts   and   . i do have some complaints though . in the first part  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool . buaku rules .  
not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts .  br    br   makeup that a child can do . acting was over done . . . poor directing . editing was very choppy . . . many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous . sound was badly dubbed . music was highly inappropriate . casting was extremely off . . . must have been on crack . zombies that talk let alone . . . drive  dance  work . . . just pisses me off . and the bad guy . . . holy crap  as horribly casted as he was . . . he was the best looking zombie of all . which doesn  t say much .  br    br   the cover art was good but very deceiving . . . as was the main menu of the dvd . . . great artwork and music .  br    br   don  t bother   
the anime that got me hooked on anime . . .  br    br   set in the year      hey  that  s not too far away now   the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence . seeing as how crimes are happening ever   seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists  the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem  cops with tanks  oh the insanity   br    br   the  heroes  of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki  a red haired japanese woman  yeah i know  they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance  who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond  blue eyed nice guy al . leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain  also known as  brenten    a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses  a big revolver and a bad temper . britain didn  t like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special  a giant green monster tank  doesn  t exactly endear her to him  nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini  tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare  where the boys are more your size  as he puts it . there  s also specs  the bifocal genius  bible quoting  god fearing chaplain  purple mo  hawked mohican  and the pot bellied chief  who  s right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics . seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them  they  re not very well liked by the people .  br    br   the  villains  are a cyborg named buaku who  s got a mysterious past that  s connected with a project known as  green peace   his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna  uni puma . in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven  t been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the  nd they  re hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku . the story  however  was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic   manga   book that  s very hard to find .  br    br   all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred . this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it  you  d better go get quentin tarantino . uneven in places but still a lot of fun .  br    br   followed by  new dominion tank police  .  
thank god  i didn  t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it  this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life  fg visual effects  unnecessary gore and nudity  far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others . there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie . ok if you get time after reading this comment  please check out the director  s  ulli lommel  profile . after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this  i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between  and  . and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him  but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence . even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie .  
fact stargate sg   is a cheesy sci  fi tv series .  br    br   there  s no escaping facts . how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg   remains a cheesy sci  fi tv series .  br    br   stargate sg   does borrow and steal ideas briskly . special fx aren  t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn  t going to blow you out of the chair . or couch for that matter either .  br    br   but  and this is where i really think stargate sg   deserves all the credit it can get  for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci  fi movie that  s actually worse than a one hour tv episode .  br    br   in fact some episodes actually could probably have been   minutes long and still have been better than most movies .  br    br   and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg   special .  br    br   i am very picky with my selections . i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught .  br    br   so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg   as yet another tacky sci  fi show  don  t . stick with it and you  ll see what i  m talking about .  
 review may contain some spoilers  i  ll make this review short and sweet . i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman . how bad could it be  right  well  it  s pretty bad . justin timberlake plays pollack  a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison  s police force . ll cool j is deed  a cop within the force on a special force team called f . r . a . t .  first response assault tactics  . he  s teamed with an  on  the  edge  bad cop named lazerov  dylan mcdermott  . in the opening scene we see lazerov  deed taking on some bank robbers  but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs . i don  t want to give to much away  but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs . pollack  who works for ashford  morgan freeman  goes to a trial involving deeds  lazerov . he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford  does some investigate that turns ugly . wallace  kevin spacey  who is all within the f . r . a . t . team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice .  br    br   you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey  s performance are pretty lackluster . the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott . he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me . ll cool j is terrible in this film . he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion . he was much better in movies like deep blue sea  any given sunday . the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film . the ending is far from satisfying .  br    br   don  t waste your time with this film . i  m putting it on ebay this weekend .  
scott bartlett  s  offon  is nine minutes of pure craziness . it is a full  frontal assault of psychedelic  pulsating  epilepsy  inducing flashing lights and colours  and the first true merging of film and video in avante  garde cinema . there  s no story to speak of  but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions  integrating these biological phenomena into the highly  industrial form of modern technology . in a sense  the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools  his machinery  his technology . this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal     in stanley kubrick  s       a space odyssey         and  indeed  bartlett  s opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close  up human eye  recalls dave bowman  s journey through the stargate . the visuals are richly  coloured  a confronting blend of sharp  vivid photography and increasingly  grainy video  as though we  re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact  the end product was recorded from a tv monitor .  br    br   there appears to be some confusion about the film  s release date . imdb lists the film as a     release  but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give     as the correct year . perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film  s completion and its first public screening . either way  the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time  occasionally reminiscent of a     s music video  and some brisk techno music wouldn  t have gone amiss  either   offon  captures grainy  fragmented images  presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information . i had a thought  and please don  t laugh at this free  thinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth  s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed  alien documentation of human life  a bizarre montage of only vaguely  familiar imagery that couldn  t possibly make any coherent sense . perhaps this is where mankind  with all his technology  is eventually heading  towards an irreversible merging of film and video  of purity and artificiality .  
ok its not the best film i  ve ever seen but at the same time i  ve been able to sit and watch it twice    story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way .  br    br   and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling .  br    br   overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it .  
i stumbled across this  act  i  by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago . this was  nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned . it amazed me . it intimidated me . it shocked me . i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later  i happened to think about it again . then went and bought both acts . they were even better than i had experienced at first .  br    br   my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime  warranting tanks and heavy artillery  it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals . that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time . if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda  it certainly has not been shown as such .  br    br   i don  t think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this . but regarding the story  there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused .  
usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant . . . i tend to support everybody  because their efforts are worth . . .  br    br   but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits   br    br   imagine the following situation  br    br    . think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far .  br    br    . think about some great  attractive art for that movie  s dvd box . . . and a promising plot . . .  br    br    . voil  you got zombie nation .  br    br   see it only if you really don  t have anything else better to do . anything is better .  
dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making . the storyline across the  parts blends mindless action  slap  stick humor  touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions . it  s hard to believe that there was only one director  as the style changes from episode to episode . a must  see movie for anyone who likes anime .  
notice i have given this  star if the option been given i would have given this zero . as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest . i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake . but it didn  t prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen .  br    br   the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best . do not let that fool you . this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world .  br    br   the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it . the acting  if you can call it that   the  plot   so many holes must look like swiss cheese   and the special effects really are just terrible .  br    br   please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch .  br    br   in the end i  m not saying i can make a better movie than this  but i am thinking it .  
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it  but have seen it  or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical  comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence . kay kyser  s mysteries would be a good example .  br    br   having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show  as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action  doing a fine job of support . hugh o  brien plays the face  buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus  abbott and costello replacing the leads . don  t know if that was true .  br    br   all in all  a pleasant movie  but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history . wish that it was released  as i haven  t seen or heard of it now in two decades . hope it is not lost  
if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it  s this pile of crap . i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity . i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it  s so insultingly poor  i can  t believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable .  br    br   there  s no plot and the non  plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking . the people don  t react  act or in any way resemble human beings . the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be . the whole thing is one pointless mess  it doesn  t go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don  t do very much .  br    br   i could make a better film than this  so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before . it  s pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time .  br    br   honestly  the very worst movie of all time . you  ll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a      and urge you to buy the dvd . i can  t imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film  it  s terrible .  br    br       and that  s generous .  
i  ve spent years looking for a copy of this film    mm  dvd  vhs   so i could show it to my kids . the movie is funny  and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . they had to be that good to play that demented . i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages .  br    br   the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse  with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band  when not fighting the fires  . there  s the usual running gags  plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra . also  comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight  man hugh o  brien .  
this movie had me going . the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard . i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors  band together  and plan to take out the zombies . dead wrong  it  s about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what  s coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge . as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved . where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation .  br    br   first off  the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face . what are zombies but mindless  debatable intelligent  cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs  these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models  they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies . sure the eating and killing is there  but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement  although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre  it makes fun of that genre and asks the question   why can  t zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines   i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies . i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much  it  s an insult and as for scarynot even .  
the performance by om puri  smita patil  and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely  along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani . the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great .  br    br   i have not seen another movie like this . it is one whole  each piece so nicely fit in the plot . you cannot not be impressed by this movie .  br    br   amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and  baap  of om puri . om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty  s at sadhashiv  s place is absoulely stunning . smita patil does not play a main role  but her part is also not distracting from the main plot .  br    br   and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . he is also the  guru  of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble .  br    br   the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya .  br    br   a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema .  
i only watched the first   minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap . the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie . no  it was a hundred times worse . ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that  s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever .  br    br   the american cop has a german accent  the  police station  was a desk in a warehouse with a sign  police station  hanging on the wall . there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet .  br    br   this cop pulls women over  cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse . he tells his cop partner to wait in the car . then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag . the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right  that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women  but he isn  t sure if that is what  s happening because  he  s a moron  the dialog is totally stupid  the acting is awful  and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen . it is totally obvious to the cop  s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it  and yet  the partner  who is there all along  doesn  t know what is happening   br    br   the director of this film is a total hack . i stopped the movie at   minutes because i couldn  t take it anymore . it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won  t waste anymore time on it writing this review .  br    br   absolutely worthless .  
directed by govind nihalani  this is definite cop film of indian cinema . may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force  politics with no holds barred  how it effects on a young cop . a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father . agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop  bad cop hindi films but this is different . today  s generation  which grown up watching dark  realistic films like   satya    company  may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making . the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn  t pay much attention to such kind of cinema  yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class  mass audience when it released . for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema  he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar . its more than cop character  he internalized a lot which is something original in acting . watch his scenes with his father whom he hates  smita whom he loves . smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level . my god what a natural expressions she carried    shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me  he  s a brilliant character actor if given a chance  here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om . the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen  sadashiv amrapurkar as  rama shetty  . it  s another story that he didn  t get such a meaty role  almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra  s b grade action films . watch the scene where om  st time becomes a rebel for his father  played by amrish puri   next both are sharing wine together . how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love  hate for each other . two faces of indian police force  masculinity  impotency and in between lies  half truth  ardh satya  kudos to nihalani  s touch . the film won  national awards as best hindi feature film  best actor  om puri   filmfare awards in best film  best director  best supporting actor categories .  br    br   recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films .  br    br   ratings       
zombie nation     r  br    br   hey  i was bored . i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch . zombie nation  hey  i love zombie movies . says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description . funny how it doesn  t warn me not to watch this film . i could  ve used that advice .  br    br   zombie nation is just like troll  in that it  s completely misnamed . it has little  if anything  depending on your point of view  to do with zombies  and takes place all within one city . this film revolves around a crooked cop  who acts as badly as possible  he has to be trying to suck this much   while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them . yup  he  s a serial killer cop . not only is this film flawed in thinking that it  s a zombie flick  it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong . serial killers enjoy killing  they live for it and they get down and personal with it . this guy knocks out the women  and injects them with some poison . he doesn  t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it . talk about boring  eventually  one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason  all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy . they were all buried or tossed into the ocean  but you wouldn  t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they  re all wearing . the women then act very poorly and take their revenge . oh yay .  br    br   this film was crap in every category . crap acting  crap writing  crappier sets  and crappier make  up effects . the women don  t look zombie  like  unless you count really dark make  up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie . they can all talk  behave  think  and act perfectly human . the gore is weak compared to even many pg    films and the nudity is beyond brief . you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence . . . then the exact same breasts later  go figure . guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite . the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they  re obviously filming in . you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set  up and even  unless you are blind  you can see the director failing . steer clear  it  s a waste of time .  br    br        
after  aakrosh   this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director . till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india . this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence . it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released . this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like  coolie    betaab    hero  in     .  br    br   smithapatel  in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him . she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs . at one time  she even gave up her love when the hero  s ruthlessness touched the roof top .  br    br   there was another character in this movie  which was played by om puri contemporary  naseeruddin shah . he played as an inspector  turned  alcoholic character . the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero  s ending .  br    br   in his debut film  sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare . the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent . the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani  s other film  drohkaal  . even after two decades  this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew . each one played their part par excellence .  
yeah  i  m sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times . man  i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear . net instead of renting it . i  m a big fan of the george romero movies and i  m pretty sure that if he saw this movie  he  d probably throw up while laughing too hard . i mean  what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie  s devils  it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer  especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop  police station  apartment  flat  whatever room it was with the gong in the background  and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop . i couldn  t even tell what nationality the killer was  and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn  t help either . oh well  what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world . so  for all of those who worship mystery science theater     or if you just like reaming on bad c movies  c for craptastic   then this is the movie for you . . . or not .  
  ardh satya  is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema . directed by the great director govind nihalani  this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success . even today  ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india .  br    br   the film tells the real  life scenario of mumbai police of the   s . unlike any police of other cities in india  mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether . govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment .  br    br   amongst various police officers  colleagues  the film describes the story of anand velankar  a young hot  blooded cop coming from a poor family . his father is a harsh police constable . anand himself suffers from his father  s ideologies  incidences of his father  s atrocities on his mother . anand  s approach towards immediate action against crime  is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction . the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand  s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors . this leads to frustrations  as he cannot achieve the desired job  satisfaction . resulting from the frustrations  his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms  bars  also turning him to an alcoholic .  br    br   the spirit within him is still alive  as he constantly fights the system . he is aware of the system of the metro  where the police  politicians are a inertly associated by far end . his compromise towards unethical practice is negative . finally he gets suspended .  br    br   the direction is a master piece  thoroughly hard core . one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty  s house to arrest him  followed by short conversation which is fantastic . at many scenes  the film has hair  raising moments .  br    br   the practical approach of script is a major punch . alcoholism  corruption  political influence  courage  deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today . those aspects are dealt brilliantly .  br    br   finally  the films belongs to the one man show  om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly .  
last weekend i bought this  zombie movie  from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of  land of the dead  .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover  art  which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre .  br    br   we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell  phone . they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car  i couldn  t suspend my disbelief anymore .  br    br   some people actually consider this a  so bad  it  s good  movie  they are liars . i didn  t finish the movie  but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie  which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through .  br    br   this is even worse than  zombiez  do not watch   
an absolute classic   the direction is flawless  the acting is just superb . words fall short for this great work . the most definitive movie on mumbai police . this movie has stood the test of times .  br    br   om puri gives a stellar performance  smita patil no less . all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment . this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society .  br    br   this is the story of a cop  om puri  who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer . the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops . kudos to nihalani    br    br   after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal  politician  police nexus . thus this movie was truly a trend setter . this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade .  br    br   this movie was a moderate box office hit .  br    br   a must  see for discerning movie fans .  
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he  s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .  br    br   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium . this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best  worst of ew . i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it .  br    br   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .  br    br   the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent . aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la . despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .  br    br   the sets are excruciatingly bad . the production designer  s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint  precinct     on a cardboard wall .  br    br   since the actors were obviously unpaid non  professionals   a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle  aged women   and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine  looking police uniforms . sadly  they couldn  t afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .  br    br   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he  s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .  br    br   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . don  t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommel  s logic and enjoy the absurd ride .  br    br   after much prolonged hand  clawing out of straw  covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make  up generously airbrushed around their eyes . looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .  br    br   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro  trash techno into the soundtrack . we  re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .  br    br   unlike other zombies  lommel  s girls speak and function as normal . . . er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified . this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . yes  a golden shower it is .  br    br   i won  t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . all i can say is it  s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . the spirit of ed wood lives on . . . or should i say his geist .  
govind nihalani  s directorial venture of vijay tendulkar  s novel is brilliant . om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty  played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar . this is govind nihlan  s most talked about movie . this is a very good and a classic film . smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri . naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role . although sadashiv amrapurkar has only  scenes in the movie he dominates the movie . this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut . om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor . filmfare award winner for best film  story  supporting actor  sadashiv amrapurkar  .  
btk killer  green river killer  zodiac killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is  he loves his crap .  br    br   i  ve never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful . like the movies i said in the beginning don  t even equal a six when added together  after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is . he is the worst out there .  br    br   the credits wouldn  t end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in . the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots . the editing is easily the worst . this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldn  t take it anymore as it wouldn  t end and i was only   minutes in the movie . i couldn  t take it anymore . i wasted   minutes of my life .  br    br   do not watch this crap   
i love this show   br    br   every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is . i am a huge sci  fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science  fiction   show in the history of film  tv . there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion . its amazing  season after season the show gets better and better .  br    br   i  ve been a fan of macgyver since i was     now  and i find it so ironic that my  favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson . its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other .  br    br   back when i first saw stargate the movie  i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci  fi flicks  then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited  but didn  t get showtime till the fifth season was almost over .  br    br   though  i  m disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead .  br    br   id say though that it turned out just fine . maybe even better .  br    br   this show is amazing  and i hope it never dies . atlantis here we come   
i rented this movie last week . i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it  so it seemed promising . and it was  until justin timberlake came on scene . he is a really bad actor and shouldn  t be allowed to make a movie ever again . i mean  he is one of the most boring  uninspired actors i  ve ever seen . he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever . why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack  i think matt damon would have been a better choice .  br    br   kevin spacey was another big disappointment . his character is so dull  it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se  en . it might sound cool  but believe me  it  s not .  br    br   now  dylan mcdermott  s acting is very good . it  s about one of the very few good things about this movie . he is just inspired .  br    br   morgan freeman is good but nothing special . he has some really cool lines though .  br    br   about the story  although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good . i was expecting a big twist when lazerov  dylan mcdermott  was killed  but nothing really happened .  
any story comprises a premise  characters and conflict . characters plotting their own play promises triumph  and a militant character readily lends oneself to this . ardh satya  s premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre . the line goes   ek palde mein napunsaktha  doosre palde mein paurush  aur teek tarazu ke kaante par  ardh satya   . a rough translation   the delicate balance of right  wrong  commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts  has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another . is the needle on the center a half  truth    br    br   the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant . it makes a deep impact on the protagonist  lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow . at the end of the film  om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem .  br    br   the film tries mighty hard to do a one  up on the poem . however  chitre  s words are too powerful  and at best  the film matches up to the poem in every aspect .  br    br    
this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life . i  m not even kidding . it was poorly made and the actors couldn  t act . it was a waste of my time and money . it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own . the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise . nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case . it appears that the director or make  up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie . the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost   minutes of the movie . which watching the credits was the best part of the movie . this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn  t believe how badly it was put together . scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like  whats going on   the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen  s joking around making a fake fight scene .  br    br   if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show  s how awful it truly is . i wish i would have watched it before i rented it .  
the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr . isn  t a particularly good documentary . aesthetically  it  s lackluster and cheap looking  the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in  cohesive  but this adds to it  s charm . i say this because it  s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and  as such  there  s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits . there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood  and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary . overall  it  s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general  but don  t expect brilliance here . expect a documentary made after wood  s own heart .  
horrible acting  bad story line  cheesy makeup  and this is just the tip of the iceberg . i have never seen a worse movie in my life   minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen . . . it didn  t .  aside from a nice breast shot  the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse  and the same warehouse was used for at least    of the sets . you even see this same red chair in several different  locations  if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment  not some warehouse which will echo all your actor  s dialog . .  note to producers  renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse  and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable  if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee . . . you will be demanding your money back . . . i only spent   .   to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off .  
i originally caught this back in     in its one week run at a movie theatre . i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven  t much changed .  br    br   documentary about the infamous edward d . wood jr . covering his life and movies . there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him . they include vampira  dolores fuller  bela lugosi jr .  loretta king  gregory walcott and paul marco . interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations . it is interesting  somewhat  but was this really needed  i  ve seen all of wood  s films and they  re just terrible . wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out . i wouldn  t say he was the worst director ever but he  s down there . do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker  i do like the fact that they didn  t try to make wood out to be some sort of saint . more than a few of those interviewed  especially lugosi jr .  pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear . also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the     s and   s . still it  s of interest if you  re a wood fan . the best interviews are with vampira  who tears wood apart  and dolores fuller  a long time girlfriend  .  
every year i watch hundreds of films  including many low budget amateurish straight  to  dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see . i have seen thousands of films in my time  many excellent  many forgettable . zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable  horror  films i have ever seen  in fact i still haven  t recovered from the experience of watching it .  br    br   the day after  it seems like some kind of weird dream . did i really see what i thought i saw  why do the police work out of a warehouse  did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the  zombies  eat cheeseburgers  is it safe  is it safe  is it safe   br    br   i wouldn  t recommend zombie nation if you want to see a  good  film  and neither would i recommend it as  so bad its good  . however  if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you . now  whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is  i will say zombie nation .  br    br   seriously  i think it  s a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one  and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude . he really is the ed wood jr . of the digital age  and i for one can  t wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one .  
i loved this film . not being a swooning ed wood jr . fan  i prefer to appreciate his  boundless enthusiasm  and acknowledge his shortcomings . his movies are fun  but his personal story is one racked with pain . i hoped  and was delighted to find  that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life  rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise . from beginning to end  this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology  leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr .  br    br   what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives  positive and negative  and showing us their character as much as ed  s . we get insight into ed  s personal and professional life from his romances  to his drinking  to his sexuality  to his friends  to his enemies  and even to his film making .  br    br   the film itself is shot in a low  budget way that seems done out of respect for ed  as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from     would be disrespectful  sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president  . the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background .  br    br   fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies  and new comers will be amazed that this man was real . the dvd is full of impossible to find gems   crossroads of lorado  and photo galleries   but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story .  br    br   ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him  for better or worse   to the point where one woman will go down in history as  swimming pool owner  for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool . this ability to define a person  s legacy comes through universally  as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr .  but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created . somehow  without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time  the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear  and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement .  br    br   even the title hints at the b  list horror genre  but by the end  we see that even this is a kindness . what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood  s legend .  br    br   in many ways a living contradiction  ed wood jr . could not be condensed to a single viewpoint . this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get . being itself a juxtaposition of themes  it is at once respectful  provocative  thoughtful  gripping  fun  sad  kind  and fulfilling .  
i  ve discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging . the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary . then you get to the movie and it  s women with raccoon masks on . zero special effects . . . and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by  feet . the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie . the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a  cult classic  . . . however  i can  t possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made . the real horror in this film is how bad it is . i  m embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again   
  the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr .  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  glen or glenda    bride of the monster   and  of course   plan  from outer space  . this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries  such as  look back in angora  and  the plan  companion   failed . it rounds up his surviving entourage  many of whom have passed away since filming  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work . nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood  sentimental in its treatment of the director  down to the haunting music   this documentary is an absolute must  see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day . the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed  s life and untimely death for the viewer . best watched at  am while wearing an angora sweater .  
this is one of the worst films ever . i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . where are the images in the film that are on the box  i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .  br    br   why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading  i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . i have no one to blame except myself . i want my money and time back .  br    br   do not watch this movie .  br    br   even if curiosity is motivating you  stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . it will be much more enjoyable . you have been warned   
this film deals with the atrocity in derry   years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday .  br    br   the film is well researched  acted and directed . it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry . the film puts the atrocity into context of the time . it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity . the disgraceful white  wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with .  br    br   overall  this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking . when the saville report comes out  watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is .  
i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film . i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising .  br    br   it  s not enough that the movie itself is a p . o . s .  but the cover art is what sold me . i  ve done better make  up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art . can you say  raccoon eyes    br    br   i  m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details  but come on  the movie  s main character is an l . a . cop who was born and raised in alabama  but has a german accent    it  s beyond insulting .  
an excellent and accurate film . . . mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off . he is not afraid to tell the truth  even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy .  br    br   once again  mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston  though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough . i found this movie as accurate  well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing . well done and my hat is off to the writer  the actors  the production crew . a great film   
i honestly want the last   minuets of my life back .  br    br   the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better .  br    br   then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes .  br    br   they talked like regular people .  br    br   one drove a car .  br    br   some voodoo woman asked what one of the  zombies  wanted and the  zombie  said  i want to dance   br    br    that was it  out came the movie i couldn  t take it any longer can i sue for a  hour of my life       
the story of a drifter  his sheep ranch boss  and the boss  s daughter is not for all tastes  but it  s still very intriguing . it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand  amongst the scenery we  ve come to know so well through other films from this region .  br    br   this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan  and i  ve been a fan of hers ever since . the cast also contains bruno lawrence  who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film  smash palace  . terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter  regan  .  br    br   sharply acted  with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads . i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america  but believe you me  the unexpurgated version is not to be missed .  
wow . i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem . i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood . i brought it home and put it on .  br    br   this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind . this was much worse . i wanted a bad movie but what i got  i didn  t know that crap like this existed amongst man . this movie seemed like a  year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it .  br    br   i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies . he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs .  br    br   if you are thinking about renting this or buying it . i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide .  don  t do it  it  s not worth it   i really have nothing nice to say about this movie . don  t do it   
i really like miikes movies about yakuza  this one i saw about  years ago and it really fued my head . never before seen such a sick and twisted thing . the story is good and the actors do their thing very well . i haven  t seen the uk or japan version  but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored . if you haven  t seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria . the i  on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes  but at the showdown i felt that something was missing  about one or two very short scenes .  br    br   all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence  that  s what i like miike for    
acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas . high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york  s social set . oh yes  don  t forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder . the all star cast features barbara stanwyck  van heflin  james mason  ava gardner  cyd charisse and nancy davis .  
anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike  s work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director . in keeping with miike  s working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script  this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller  with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with . what takes the movie out of the realms of the same  old same  old however  is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today  s cinema . and this isn  t that nice cool  clean violence so beloved of us cinema  this stuff is nasty  painful and hurts  that said  the pace is breakneck  the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities  miike  s sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments  and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be  making it hard to look away from the screen  whatever he might be showing you  it doesn  t have the  ohmigod  ending of  dead or alive   but if you  re not squeamish  now  s the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio  s  new john woo  shopping list . . .  
the animation in this re  imagining of peter  the wolf is excellent  but at   minutes  the film is sleep inducing . they should have called it  peter  the snails   because everything moves at a snail  s pace . i couldn  t even watch the film in one sitting  i had to watch it   minutes at a time  and it was pure torture .  br    br   save yourself   minutes  do not watch this film  and you will thank me .  br    br   i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees . unfortunately  to vote for the winner in the best animated short  short   category  the voters will have to sit through the whole thing . i already feel sorry for them  and must predict that there  s no way this film will come close to winning .  
i love jack  s jokes like  the clich is . . .  or  over the top clich guy  black  oily skin  kinda spooky . . .  . he is just hilarious  daniel  s starting to catch up on him to  good thing jack  s not on the team anymore  in a way  or else it would have been sarcasm mania     i just love all the plots  season   a little less  i have to admit   the characters are great  the actors are great  i  m starting to pick up facial expressions  and more  from jack  daniel and teal  c . . . it just all theoretically possible and exciting . . . oops  their i go again    sorry  i  m also starting to pick up traits from carter  and all of this is driving my parents nutz        well  to conclude  i think it  s good for another three seasons or so  especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor  drama  action and so forth                  
ll cool j . morgan freeman . dylan mcdermott . kevin spacey . john heard . cary elwes . roslyn sanchez . justin timberlake   wait a minute . justin timberlake  and he  s the star  i should have known better than to rent edison force . in fact  i did know better . but in a moment of absolute weakness  i rented this stv . when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv  you know it  s one of two things an indie or a dog . as in sat  on  a  shelf . which this did . and with good reason . the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force  and  journalist  timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them . he is targeted for his efforts   or maybe i should say for his horrible acting . i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing . just awful . the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard  looking like nothing so much as a hobo . you just know the director was not in control . freeman is clearly slumming .  
the movie starts something like a less hyper  kinetic  more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers . but when a police officer is killed  one tatsuhito gets involved . . . and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved  things get bloody quite fast .  br    br   an earlier work of miike  s  shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol  ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts  though it  s not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces . rather  it  s a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction  as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground  a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost  brothel of young boys  one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning  . tatsuhito  s brother is getting involved with said society  so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm .  br    br   what  s mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis  wang . tatsuhito is a japanese born in china  later moved back into japan  and alienated for it . wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china  so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan . wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character  which is weird enough as it is  much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be . and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he  s forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother . while it would be rude to state that miike  s movies are successful mostly on their shock value  it is true that sometimes it  s easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter  dis  impassioned characters .  br    br     polarisdib  
this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale . a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy . they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence . however  after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence . however  out of no where  when they are on a luxury cruise  the ship sinks and they lose everything   and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life  what an odd  silly and preachy film  personally  i  d like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable   br    br   the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions   a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .  
while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike  s later films this is a very good crime drama .  br    br   the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster . complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang . the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust . its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film .  it is a very very good one  this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don  t mind a no frantic pace .  br    br   a word of warning  the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty . there are also semi  graphic depictions of gay sex . if thats not your cup of tea  proceed with caution .  br    br    or  out of   .  
bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry  as fred and emily hill  receive an advance on an inheritance . they use the money go traveling . their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann  for mr . kendall  and lonely percy marmont  for ms . barry  . but  they remain as boring as they were before . arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well  titled  as quoted in the film  from shakespeare  s  the tempest    rich and strange  by ordering up some camera trickery . an opening homage to king vidor  s  the crowd  is the highlight . the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared cat .  br    br    rich and strange           alfred hitchcock  henry kendall  joan barry  percy marmont  elsie randolph  
i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why . one of the problems is the cultural  language one . here we have a chinese  taiwanese  japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties . another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences . nevertheless  it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that . plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence  a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect . all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one .  
yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation . as with juno and the paycock  you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie . there is almost no style or craft to it at all . the story revolves around fred and emily  a young married couple  who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage . emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted  wealthy man who falls in love with her  but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband . this might seem more believable if fred weren  t made out to be a completely insensitive  pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman . the couple ends up staying together  but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene . the third act goes in a completely different direction  with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat . joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband . that  s about all you can say for this one .  
shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals . why  could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk  and the victims enjoy it  or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull  these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story . it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon .  br    br   should you see this film  yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema . the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters . if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar  barring the insane ending in doa of course  . great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano . the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd . if i haven  t put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i  m sure it will come out in that country .  
i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together  the talk is not of the master  s great films like  north by northwest  or  strangers on a train   but a lesser  known effort like this one from      obscure and seriously flawed  which showcases the great director in fledgling form .  br    br   emily and fred hill  joan barry and harry kendall  are a middle  class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle  saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun .  br    br   just ask richard hannay  roger o . thornhill  or marion crane . well  marion  s indisposed at the moment  but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight  setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock  s earliest foray into this theme  and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element  in this case domestic drama rather than suspense  but the two do not cohere  at least not here .  br    br   the hills are a dull  flat couple  with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies bergre  in the form of cross  cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film  they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers .  the curtain  s gone up too soon   gasps emily .  they aren  t dressed .   br    br   when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise  it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing  even if the people they partner off with are drips  too . emily  s man  gordon  percy marmont  carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs  which he suggests be filled by emily . fred  s girl  the princess   betty amann  has clara bow  s eyes and wallace beery  s five o  clock shadow . there  s also an obnoxious fellow passenger  a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come .  br    br   everything is shot in an abrupt manner  with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn  t come off  and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off  they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged  together rickshaws  one of many clunky attempts at symbolism .  br    br   emily  s the only vaguely sympathetic character  in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon  but mostly because she  s among the first of hitchcock  s many magnetic blondes  her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film  s conclusion .  br    br   matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set  piece for the protagonists to come to grips with  and presumably repair their relationship . only they aren  t active participants in the resolution  and except for the fate of a friendly cat  nothing about the ending resonates .  br    br   at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early     s  and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food .  rich and strange  is hitchcock paying his dues  and learning his trade  one for scholars but not casual film goers .  
shinjuku triad society  albeit from perfect  is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber  conventional realm . it  s a yakuza  triad picture  involving cops versus japanese   or chinese gangsters  mostly chinese  as the title suggests   but already even in his first technical  debut   takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here  on in . social issues like black market trading of precious goods  in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one  s roots  which was especially prevalent in dead or alive   thumbing  of  the  nose at taboos like gay sex and  satirical  rape  violence towards women blood  curdling violence . it  s certainly not as surreal as some of miike  s most recent films  but this is expected as he  s trying out things that he  s just starting to learn  following a track record of straight to video programmers . it  s got all of those qualities  and it  s also  like the films that would follow from it  equally savage and heartfelt  crazy  in spots  and sardonic in its drama  and solid for genre fans .  br    br   the story concerns two brothers  one a chinese orphan raised in japan  tatsuhito kiriya  kippei shiina  pretty decent as a eastwood  esquire anti  hero  hero   who  s become a detective  and another  who  s become a gangster  or a would  be one . the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang  a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare  time  played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes   and his partner karino  takeshi caesar  who  s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who  s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal   who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie . there  s some intrigue involving the organ  trading scheme with the gangsters  which kiriya almost becomes a victim of  and the gang  s penchant for gay sex  at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want . it all leads up to vengeance and redemption  qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare  hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying  it won  t come off   .  br    br   if it doesn  t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have  it  s par for the course of a film like this . miike  s goals are met  though just met  in his low  scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble  the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents   notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime  and what the realm of unrepentant sex  with both sexes  brings out psychologically in the characters . at the same time  shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black  comedy from the miike oeuvre . some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness  like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face  or the randomness of the  interrogation  as it goes into a very twisted area . there  s even a laugh  out  loud line from the young sex  slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses  thank you  mr . weeny  burger .  miike and his writer don  t have enough here to make the film a full  on dark comedy like ichi or  of course  visitor q  but there  s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters .  br    br   as the first entry of the  black society  trilogy  as it  s called  i was quite impressed  and it  s a fine quasi  calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema .  
there is no suspense in this serial  when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy  the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day . no  in fact  the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode  this show is so boring that i can  t see how it ever got made  let alone released on dvd  obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films  but even the script is awful . an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that  i am not quite sure  because it is too awful to follow . watch the   s version  or the    s versions  or even batman begins  just anything over this version   
this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start . the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films  if you look close enough . shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza . the kid brother is a lawyer  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one  as the movie progresses . the movie takes place in a very harsh environment  and is therefore pretty violent and tough . miike has done worse  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard . as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex  mostly homosexual in this one . the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie  but with a great drive and true grittiness . if you  ve only seen miikes far  out movies  ichi the killer  fudoh etc .  this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over  the  top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side  as seen in the other films of the trilogy . and as always with miike  there are at least two scenes in this that you  ll never forget  see it and figure out which ones for yourself  .  br    br        
 . . . this would have been what you got .  br    br   words alone cannot describe how bad this is . if you  re having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you  ll be out in fifteen minutes .  br    br   robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the   s   but he  s phoning it in here . in an interview  johnny  duncan  robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight  duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder   in fact he  s more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape .  br    br   driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al  s used car lot at below sticker price   the dynamic duo don  t put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it  s bruce wayne  s car they  re driving   in fact it  s noted by several characters throughout the serial .  br    br   the acting is wooden   the sets are cheap   the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i  m sure it read along the lines of  batman says something here  because it certainly seems like they  re making it up as it goes along .  br    br   batman  s utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets   in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts   never to be seen again . his cowl is so bad he can  t even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike .  br    br   in one scene  i am not making this up   batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods . it  s radioactive so he can trace it   the reason it  s so highly flammable isn  t explained . well  unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse   we know it  s a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out   and soon the whole place burns to the ground . thanks batman   br    br   in another scene after the batmobile is disabled  batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car   leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one  yes  you guessed it  said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds . not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city .  br    br   there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman   she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce  s house   or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood .  br    br   everything about this serial is bad   and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen . if you  re looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark   if you want entertainment  try the burton batman films  the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial .  
a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true  miike  film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich . but  like all clichs  it is based on the truth . all the miike trademarks are here  the violence  the black humour  the homosexuality  the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character . shinjuku is however  one of miike  s most perfectly formed films . he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different  but not necessarily better . i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film .  br    br   as you might expect  the violence is utterly visceral  gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face .  only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that .  the film has a fantastic pace  unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle . dead or alive also deals with similar issues  miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here  the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past .  br    br   i cannot sing shinjuku  s praises enough . i do not want to give away too much . this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano  s sonatine . the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you  ll be popping it back on again to work it all out .  
granting the budget and time constraints of serial production  batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any  cliffhanger  list  utterly lacking the style  imagination  and atmosphere of its     predecessor  batman .  br    br   the producer  sam katzman  was known as  king of the quickies  and  like his director  spencer bennett  seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement .  unfortunately  this team also produced the two superman serials  starring kirk alyn  with their tacky flying animation  canned music  and dull supporting players .  the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles   robin rescues batman    batman vs wizard    mechanical music droning on  and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around  either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks . batman  s cowl  with its devil  s horns and eagle  s beak  fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes . his  utility belt  is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments  from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments   br    br   in any case  the lead players are miscast . robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne  and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman . he creates the impression that he  d rather be somewhere  anywhere else  john duncan  as robin  has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue . he is too old for the part  with an even older stuntman filling in for him . out of costume  lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink  without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the     serial .  br    br   although serials were not known for character development  the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast . this one offers a group going through the motions  not that the filmmakers provide much support . not one of the hoodlums stands out  and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever   the wizard .   great name   actually  they are led by someone sporting a curtain  a shawl  and a sack over his head  with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing . the  prime suspects    an eccentric professor  a radio broadcaster   are simply annoying .  br    br   even the established comic book  regulars  are superfluous . it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne . despite the perils she faces  vicki displays virtually no emotion . commissioner gordon is none  too  bright . unlike in the previous serial  alfred the butler is a mere walk  on whose most important line is  mr wayne  s residence .  they are props for a drawn  out  gimmick  laden  incoherent plot  further saddled with uninspired  repetitive music and amateurish production design . the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle  class home in any sitcom  the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel . the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing .  the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet    br    br   pity that the filmmakers couldn  t invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure . while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious  batfan   one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box . they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all   chapters of batman and robin combined .  br    br   now for the good news   this is not the     version   
this was the beginning of it all  granted  this is not friends at its best  but this was the show  s pilot  let  s not forget and not a bad one at that . we  re introduced to the gang and central perk  where our story begins . even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross  rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years  when ross says  i just want to be married again  and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on . . . probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica  joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back . something else . . in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes  the so  called  flashbacks  this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions . nevertheless  the point is this a fine start to a great show . this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them  with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was  keep watching  first season is a blast    
this show made me feel physically sick  and totally detached from british society as a whole . it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there were  are no class divisions in britain . they  d always say things like  go into your loft and you may find this . .  or  go into your back garden tonight and . . .   what about us  scummy  working class kids who never never had a  loft   and a  back garden  which was nothing more than a  meter square of balcony on the   th floor of a council block  public service broadcasting  yeah right  and on top of that  it was awfully depressing to see those stupid  middle class  up  their  own  backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having  fun  . . . do me a favour  and  why don  t you  go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on  mama and papa  s  money . . . you make me sick  
here it is . . the first ever episode of friends  where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar  courtney cox   newly divorced ross gellar  david schimmer   hippy pheobe buffay  lisa kudrow   unknown actor and ladies man  matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing  matthew perry  . this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the  th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green  jennifer aniston  .  br    br   the episode is better than most people give credit for  like any new sitcom the first episode isn  t always fantastic . the acting in this episode isn  t great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters  apart from kudrow and perry  who shine  .  br    br   matt le blanc  man  his acting was down right dreadful because until later  he gets more confident  but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails .  br    br   david schimmer  why does he over pronounce every word  he cannot speak normally  but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons  but he isn  t confident . and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston  looks hot  and does a good job as rachel green  but we only see the real rachel later in the  st season  courtney cox  looks quite anorexic in this episode  its worrying  she looks totally different now   more healthily   she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this   minute pilot  lisa kudrow and matthew perry  i  m doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb  and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe  pheebs  and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically  the episode quality does improve later    such as the sets  they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly  the acting is ok  the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot  i hope we see the friends reunite  cause they will always be there for us   
he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero  s acting and the hole thing was . . . . . . . . . . . . . i can  t believe that steven segal  s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making  th rate films with  th rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .  br    br   the plot is unbelievable as a movie  and even if you excuse the visuals  and had read this story as a novel  you  d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .  br    br   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm  and in some scenes he doesn  t show up at all .  br    br   i hate to repeat other peoples comments  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .  br    br   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a   million dollar budget  segal being paid  of that  and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur .  br    br   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie  as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie .  
and that  s how the greatest comedy of tv started  it has been   years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season . because that  s where  friends  is based on quotes . extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let  s say a big thanks to rachel  ross  monica  joey  chandler and phoebe    in our first meet  we see how rachel dumps a guy  in the church  how . . .  understand   monica  s search for the  perfect guy   there is no perfect guy  why all you women are obsessed with that      and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she  s a lesbian . till we meet joey  phoebe and chandler in the next episodes . . . enjoy friends   
i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is . i was sold on the promise of action  with segal and stealth aircraft  which normally make for an entertaining action movie . i can honestly say i  d rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again . the acting was so awful that it was almost funny . the story was insanely weak  with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f    through them . the script was so poor  if i found out that a   year old wrote it i shouldn  t be in the least surprised . the direction and production is so amateur  i wouldn  t even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video . utter utter drivel . those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art  and they should be ashamed of themselves . steven segal should never ever show his face in public again  i can  t imagine what made him agree to star in this  the worst film i have seen in my entire life .  
stargate sg   is a spin off of sorts from the     movie  stargate .  i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject . the show gets it rolling from the very first episode  a retired jack o  neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion  dr . daniel jackson . through the first two episodes  we meet samantha carter  a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her  and there is teal  c  a quiet  compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team .  br    br   the main bad guys are called the gouald  they are parasites who can get inserted into one  s brain  thus controlling them and doing evil deeds . any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a  system lord .  the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa  who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person  s brain .  br    br   through the episodes  we mostly get to see sg    the exploratory team comprised of jack  daniel  teal  c  and sam  go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets  this device is called the stargate  and they encounter new cultures or bad guys . some episodes are on  world  meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth .  br    br   through the years  you start to see a decline in the sg   team as close knit  and more character  building story lines . this  in turn means even more on  world episodes  which is perfectly understandable .  br    br   my rating  .          while most of this show is good  there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years . but still  top notch science fiction   
how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up  with enough cops to run a mini  war that include such weapons as flamethrowers  you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying  thanks  to a corrupt cop .  br    br   you will never get your   ish minutes back . life is too precious to rent this movie .  br    br   i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie .  br    br   if you like justin timberlake  feel free to rent this movie . he does have a very major part in it  so fans might enjoy seeing him .  br    br   however  i believe most of his fans are young girls  who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .  
the pilot is extremely well done . it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes . i don  t think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show . it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part . although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode  a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot . an example would be ross and rachels future relationship . even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared  it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice .  br    br   bravo .  br    br   a great start to an unbeatable comedy   
i own almost every seagal movie  yes even ones like this that are low budget   and i must say  this may be the worst  not only of his movies  but of all movies ever made . the only highlight of this film  and only reason i gave it  stars instead of   is that a . it is seagal  and b . seagal does have some sweet action sequences  specifically in the store  and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife . next time give me   minutes of seagal killing people  and don  t even bother with a story line  because the storyline not only stunk  but so did the acting  the fact that f     s and f     s somehow changed into f    s  and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f    . also the stealth never had to refuel    and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point . last i checked  afghanistan has no air force  we  usa  control the skies . also  this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room  yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret . also  how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck  to the top  please tell us why they jailed him  since when are air force pilots great commandos  unless they are owen wilson   and since when are their drunks in arab countries  considering muslims don  t drink alcohol  also on top of that  since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the   in charge  the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store  and the other   people he killed with a knife  as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .  
in the very first episode of friends  which aired   sept      the one where monica gets a roommate  there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show  the line that plays is  if you ever need holding  . . . . does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song  it is seems as if it is a great song . . . . i would love to get a copy of it . thanks for the assistance . i am looking for the album  cd it is on so i can purchase it .  br    br   i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again . it just seemed to be believable . . . thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years .  
well  i can once and for all put an end to the question  what is the worst movie ever made . . . ever   it is flight of fury  starring and co  written by steven seagal . sure there are lots of famously bad movies  but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously .  br    br   it is a romanian  made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood . it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become . this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry  knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again .  br    br   it was released only on video  i can  t imagine why  and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd  s had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .  
in this first episode of friends  we are introduced to the  main characters of the series monica geller  phoebe buffay  chandler bing  ross geller  joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green .  br    br   we discover that rachel  a rich girl that is monica  s friend from high school times  left her fianc  barry  at the altar  since she discovered she didn  t love him . she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father  getting a new job as a waitress in central perk .  br    br   ross  for the other hand  discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan  her partner .  we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode   br    br   monica  in this episode  makes out  and eventually sleeps  with paul  the wine guy   who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife . but in reality  he was just deceiving her .  br    br   ps i just loooove joey  s and chandler  s haircuts in this first season     
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning  br    br   the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other . a renegade pilot  steve touissant  steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it . so they are forced to send in their best man john sands  seagal  who else   to stop him  in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he  s learned over the years .  br    br   i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought . but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man  by the same director  wasn  t bad and  what the hell  seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe  just maybe  he could make a great film again . oh what a fool i was .  br    br   dubbing  horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets  awful camera work  cheap production values  risible  unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal  s trademark and a boring  sleep inducing plot that doesn  t go anywhere .  br    br   thankfully his next film  once upon a time in the hood  which i  ll be skipping   apparently marks the end of his contract with sony  meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres . hell  he  s done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him  rocky balboa .   br    br   this isn  t a flight of fury . it isn  t even a flight of fun . it  s a flight that fails to even take off the ground .   
why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy  it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a  . proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film .  br    br   it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die . the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining .  br    br   i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre .  br    br       come on yankies get your english up to par   
unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under  minutes .  br    br   the plot  even for a seagal film  the plot is just stupid . i mean its not just bad  its barely coherent .  br    br   the acting  unbelievably wooden . literally seen better acting in porno  s . ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a  lesbian love scene  which is utterly cringe  worthy .  br    br   special effects  wouldn  t look out of place in a    s sword and sorcery flick .  br    br   unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures  don  t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd  as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .  
masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby  julia anderson   ciff addison  martin donovan  are driving home  however while talking cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road . cliff  s airbag works ok  he walks away with minor injuries  unfortunately for abby hers didn  t  she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car  doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body . abby  s life is saved  just . she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured  horribly disfigured from the burns . cliff decides that she should die  his selfish lawyer ira  corbin bersen  thinks they should let abby die  sue the car manufacturer  get rich while abby  s mum pam  linda sorenson  wants to blame cliff  get rich  save abby . however abby has other plans of her own . . .  br    br   this american canadian co  production was directed by rob schmidt  whose only horror film previously was wrong turn       which on it  s own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode   was episode  from season  of the masters of horror tv series  while i didn  t think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i  ve seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same  still doesn  t come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution       . the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn  t anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i  d say it  s a bit uneven  the first   minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for   odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby  s life  the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory  twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart . the character  s are a bit clichd  the weak man  the bent lawyer  the protective mum  the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough  the dialogue is ok  the story moves along at a nice pace  overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here  there where it loses it  s focus a bit  i wasn  t that keen on the ambiguous ending .  br    br   director schmidt does a good job  there are some effective scenes  this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere  out  and  out blood  gore . there are some fantastic special make  up effects as usual  there  s shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body  the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross  images  make  up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser        it  s sequels   then there  s the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close  ups of scalpels slicing skin open  him peeling it off the muscle  putting it into a cooler box  very messy . there are also various assorted body parts . there  s some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked . . .  br    br   technically right to die is excellent  the special effects are brilliant  as most masters of horror episodes it doesn  t look like a cheap made  for  tv show which basically if the truth be told it is . the acting was fine but there  s no big  names  in this one .  br    br   right to die is another enjoyable  somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene  well worth a watch . . . for those with the stomach .  
steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse .  br    br   this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people  in self defence  he  s active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich  evil english villain  that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days .  br    br   suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent . the story isn  t interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story  characters of movie as a whole such as the  lesbian  interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn  t even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn  t need to .  br    br   in short a terrible script with bad dialog  delivered by sub  par actors  boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes  and non  relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near  impossible and make the movie even worse .  br    br   save   minutes of your life and give this miss  even if you are seagal  s most ardent fan .  
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining .  right to die  is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore .  br    br   spoilers here  br    br   top credits also go to the dead  on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen . playing the character in a great  aloof  fashion  you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails . corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not  so  good  guy who gets his just desserts .  br    br   end of spoiler .  br    br   as a revenge  from  the  dead flick   right to die  benefits heavily from it  s performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour .  
i just watched this movie on starz . let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting  writing  directing  special effects  camera crew  sound  and lighting . it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie . apparently back in      when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for    million . now  a  days those things cost about   billion and they cant go invisible . apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour . there was a completely random lesbian scene  which i didn  t mind  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it . the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes . oh yeah  since its a steven segal movie  its predictable as hell . all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane .  
this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh  i think mick garris has a problem with women . . . he kill  em all  they are often the victims  screwfly solution  pro  life  valerie on the stairs  i don  t remember the argento  s episode in season   etc .  obviously imprint  . i think he enjoys to watch women been burn  torture  mutilated and i don  t know . never least  right to die  is one of the best  with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense  specially with the photos from the cell scene  wonderful  . the acting is like the entire series  regular i could be worst like  pro  life  or  we scream for ice cream  . also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode . the ideology of the series is horrible  killing and terminating women  mutilating animals and on and on . . . the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like  cigarrette burns   the best of all    homecoming   the most funny    imprint   really shocking  .  
nobody could like this movie for its merit but  if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst  quality  then this is for you . it ranks up there with  road house  for its preposterous characters  sets and story line . the bad writing really cracked me up  i want you to dust those guys off  instead of  . . . dust those guys .  f    s take off from the carrier but  when they get into formation  they  re f    s  without a hint of anger or skepticism  segal goes back to work for the general who  only minutes before  was overseeing a covert  mind wipe  on seagal . segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards . so naturally  the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too  the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway . the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling . then segal flies it back to california  the long way  i . e .  by way of europe  even though there  s a carrier giving him air support   minutes away in the arabian sea . the cic in the carrier consists of  black pcs   flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls . what a hoot   
i  m not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a  master  in the genre of horror  since he previously just directed one horror film called  wrong turn  and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre  but fact is that he made with  right to die  one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the  masters of horror  franchise . there was a similar underdog story in season one  when william malone made on of the best episodes with  the fair haired child  even though his other long feature films  fear dot com  and  house on haunted hill  sucked pretty badly .  br    br   the story of  right to die  cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia  but thankfully also features multiple old  fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance  murderous conspiracies  pitch black humor and comic book styled violence . whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband  s continuous adultery  the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident . cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially . whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney  corbin bernsen of  the dentist   want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor  abbey  s mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff . meanwhile abbey  s hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff  s surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices . after a few victims  cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well .  right to die  is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv  series concept like  masters of horror  . it  s violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences . the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well  yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons . the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling . actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks  which is always a welcome plus  and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean  spirited and egocentric bastard . great  moh  episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons .  
first of all  f    is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft .  br    br   secondly  the f    s and f    s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers .  br    br   thirdly  the f   has only one m   cannon  not two .  br    br   last but not the least  at the end of the film  seagle selected sidewinder missile . but somehow when he pulled the trigger  the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick . as i have the experience of seeing f    s and f    s being mysteriously transformed into f    s  this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me . however  there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f   . . .  br    br   when students hand in really bad work  teachers assign   s . now i think for the sake of properly marking this film  imdb should seriously consider adding a       option . otherwise  it is not fair for those who receive  out of   . . .  
well its about time . i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season  s entries . while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries  at least this episode turned out well . its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season . in  right to die  we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey . at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation . abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back . while they speak  they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises  but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire . and this is just the setup people . once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes . there  s also a side effect too . every time she flatlines  abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people . hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever . from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it  right to die should have the right to go on living forever .  
over the years i  ve seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies  and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley  the entertainment level is at a low . sure  the action sequences were amusing  but that was pretty much it . seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege  under siege   and executive decision  at least on the action standpoint   but during the past ten years  these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications .  br    br   on the more positive side  the movie did make good use of time  like some of the action sequences and use of wit . just when the movie seemed to just drag on  a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter . i honestly believe that more of segal  s movies would do better if he wasn  t the only one that fans recognize in the movie . supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing  and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses  maybe the movie will get more popular results .  
a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident . when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state  the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live . the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him .  br    br   this comes to us from director rob schmidt  who made  wrong turn   a film i have not seen  . with only one horror film under his belt  and not a particularly notorious one at that  i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode  expecting schmidt to be a  master of horror  in only the most liberal sense . my apologies to him for my underestimation . as of episode   in a   episode season  this was actually the best one yet .  br    br   the issue of the  right to die  is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device . however  this is only the foundation on which the story revolves . once the horror elements show up  the film goes from  decent  to  spectacular  . great acting  great plot  great dialogue  great suspense . i was a little creeped out at times  which is good  and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance  i read a review of this episode prior to watching it  where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of  hellraiser  in this . through the first part of the show  i had no idea what they were talking about . then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of  hellraiser   . however  i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film . i can see no other way to create the effect that was created  and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than  hellraiser   .  br    br   some plot twists show up later on  and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look . i didn  t watch it a second time  but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had  not that it  s confusing  . the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice  and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him . he  s somewhat of an anti  hero to the whole story  if you will . i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist  but he  s completely unlovable .  br    br   while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i  m excited about the  washingtonians  episode  i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine . when legends like john carpenter let me down  again  i get a bit worried about the genre  s future  but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope . this one is a keeper  and please bring schmidt back for season    
you  ve gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be  he does have good taste in women . if you pick a seagal movie  chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it . and usually  they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight  shoot guns  kill with knives  etc .  flight of fury  offers the duo of ciera payton  who has a very sexy face  with luscious lips to match angelina jolie  s  and katie jones  and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling  and if it seems like i  m spending a little too much time talking about them  it  s because the rest of the movie  although passable  is so unexciting that it  s hard to find much else to talk about . ironically  the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself  who looks as if he can  t even be bothered to try to pretend to care . this being a military  type actioner  there is very little fighting in it  and he doesn  t fit into his role  a stealth fighter pilot   the best in the world   of course  very well  which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .        
stargate sg   follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate . in the stargate universe  humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa  uld such as ra and apophis . for millennia  the goa  uld harvested humanity  heavily influencing and spreading human cultures . as a result  earth cultures such as those of the aztecs  mayans  britons  the norse  mongols  greeks  and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy . many well  known mythical locations such as avalon  camelot  and atlantis are found  or have at one time existed .  br    br   presently  the earth stargate  found at a dig site near giza in      is housed in a top  secret u . s . military base known as the sgc  stargate command  underneath cheyenne mountain . col . jack o  neill  anderson   dr . daniel jackson  shanks   capt . samantha carter  tapping  and teal  c  judge  compose the original sg   team  a few characters join and  or leave the team in later seasons  . along with   other sg teams  they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa  uld  in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races .  br    br   the parasitic goa  uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . throughout the first eight seasons  the goa  uld are the primary antagonists . they are a race of highly intelligent  ruthless snake  like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species  including humans . the original arch  enemy from this race was the system lord apophis  peter williams  . other system lords  such as baal and anubis  play pivotal roles in the later seasons . in the ninth season a new villain emerges  the ori . the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy  also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori  their followers  and their enemiesthe ancients .  
if you watched this movie you know why i said  jesus  jesus  jesus  . hehehe    every time they said  jesus  jesus  jesus  . . . i laughed thinking  jesus  jesus  jesus  why did i rent this movie   i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen . wtf is timberlake  dreaful acting  i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job  this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him . . . but i really prefer an actor  not this android called timberlake . and his girlfriend was shallow  hollow and annoying as hell . i was happy when they both were popped in the street .  br    br   the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well . the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all . it would have been much enjoyable without him .  br    br   by the way  the music was ok  but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes  low motion and things like that . something misplaced for this cops movie i thought . maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake .  
fans of the hbo series  tales from the crypt  are going to love this moh episode . those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on  will recognize this one right off the bat .  br    br   underrated indie favorite martin donovan  also an excellent writer  co  author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her  is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way . he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy  next  door  or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness . in the case of right to die  he takes the latter approach  and it definitely works .  br    br   donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist  robin sydney   much to the displeasure of his inconsolable  unforgiving spouse  abbey  julia anderson  . when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of  making up   and she  s horribly burned in a fire  he  s reluctant to pull the plug on her  not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy  corbin bernsen  looking the worse for wear these days .   br    br   but abbey  s never been one to give up without a fight  and that  s where the ec  theme of the episode comes in . cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genre  s favorite subject matter for some spooky  and ooky  supernatural shenanigans  and this case is definitely no exception . if anything  the ramped  up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere .  br    br   and that  s not to mention that john esposito  s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist . you don  t realize as you  re watching that you only know half the story  until close to the end . . .  think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas  and you  re there .   br    br   not a bad effort  but not the best of the lot  either . at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction  especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed  as with most moh episodes  this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment  so the extremely squeamish need not apply .  
this movie should have never been made .  br    br   what a shame of the budget .  br    br   please hire convincing actors  and make a proper movie . very thin plot  and unconvincing lines . almost hilarious  and that is a shame for an action movie . . . .  br    br   definitely not worth watching .  br    br   they keep replaying the same  shots  of an stealth airplane flying away . you have seen it ones  and that was not worth re  running  or  times .  br    br   it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie  making .  br    br   his movies are getting worser every time .  br    br   black dawn  and submerged were already bad  but this movie is even worse .  
i was all ready to pan this episode  seeing that this  master  really doesn  t have any horror films under his belt . . but this is easily the best episode of the season .  br    br   the acting was good   i don  t know how he wrangled it  but we  ve got some real talent in this episode  and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise  at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full   mins  something that has been lacking up to this point in the series .  br    br   i especially liked the bit at the end  not a twist per say  but just a funny little bit where he becomes  as ever  the hen  pecked hubby .  br    br   really good effort . like i  ve said in other reviews  these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes . . but they may someday end up being masters in the future .  
steven seagal  mr . personality himself  this time is the united states  greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military  . . who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base  later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station  if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday  who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor . along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor  jannick  mark bazeley   john sands  seagal  will fly into enemy territory  receiving help from his arab lover  jessica  ciera payton  and a freedom fighter  rojar  alki david  once they are on ground . jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders  stone  vincenzo nicoli  and his female enforcer  eliana  katie jones   and sands must figure out how to not only re  take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter  but rescue him as well . and  maybe  sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained  rather  steve toussaint  in the process . sands has   hours until a general  s navy pilots bomb the entire area . on board the stealth  black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb  hoping to detonate it on the united states .  br    br   seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn  t slicing their throats with knives . the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead . the setting of afghanistan doesn  t hold up to scrutiny  . . nor does how easily seagal and co . are able to move about the area undetected so easily  and the plot itself is nothing to write home about . the movie is edited fast  the camera a bit too jerky . seagal isn  t as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes  unlike the good old days . one of seagal  s poorest efforts  and he  s as understated as ever  . . not a compliment  . even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film  s chief villains  tis a shame . he doesn  t even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way  . . sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around  but it  s not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close  ups  .  
maybe it  s just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff  but this one got under my skin  pardon the pun  . this piece is brave  not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies . not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the  screwee   i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself . some parts are very reminiscant of  hellraiser   but come off as tribute rather than imitation . it  s a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider  but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile . this piece brings it and doesn  t appologize . i liked this one a lot . do not watch whilst eating pudding .  
flight of fury starts as general tom barnes  angus macinnes  organises an unofficial test flight of the x     a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible . general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher  steve toussaint  the job  everything goes well until the x    disappears  even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan  delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone  vincenzo nicoli  who plans to use the x    to fly into us airspace undetected  drop some bombs which will kills lots of people . general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane  sends in one man army john sands  co  writer  executive producer steven seagal  to get it back  kill all the bad guy  s in the process . . .  br    br   this american  british  romanian co  production was directed by michael keusch  was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man        attack force        luckily someone decided the partnership wasn  t working  an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration  s between the two . apparently flight of fury is an almost scene  for  scene word  for  word remake of black thunder       starring michael dudikoff with many of the same character  s even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder  therefore cannot compare the two . flight of fury is a terrible film  the poorly made  written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days . it  s boring even though it  s not that slow  the character  s are poor  it  s full of clichs  things happen at random  the plot is poor  the reasoning behind events are none existent  it  s a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed . the action scenes are lame  there  s no real excitement in it  the villains are boring as are the heroes  it  s right down there with the worst seagal has made .  br    br   flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn  t even matched up that well  the background can change  peoples clothes change  the area changes  the sky  the quality of film changes very abruptly as it  s all too obvious we are watching clips from other  better  films spliced in . hell  seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this . the action scenes consist of shoot  outs so badly edited it  s hard to tell who is who  of course seagal breaking peoples arms . the whole production feels very cheap  shoddy .  br    br   the imdb reckons this had a budget of about            which i think is total rubbish  i mean if so where did all the money go  although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods  it was actually shot in romania  the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan . the acting is terrible as one would expect  seagal looks dubbed again .  br    br   flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring  amateurish  is an almost scene  for  scene remake of another film anyway . another really lazy  poorly produced action thriller from seagal  why do i even bother any more   
this was a superb episode  one of the best of both seasons . down right horror for a change  with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes  if there is such a thing . a man  s wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck  in which he was driving . his airbag worked  her  s didn  t . she is burned beyond recognition  great makeup btw   and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft . but  even in a coma  she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology  and when she does die for a few minutes  her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit . carnage of course ensues  and also some extremely gory killings  and also  some extremely sexy scenes . what more could you ask for  you might ask  well  not much  because this baby has it all  and a very satirical ending  that should leave a smile on most viewers faces . i just loved rob schmidt  s  wrong turn  direction too  he has a great knack for horror . excellent episode  this is one i  m buying for sure .  
flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i  ve ever seen . . . up to now .  br    br   it  s a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest  seagal isn  t really trying in this  he  s fat and his voice is dubbed once more .  br    br   the co  stars fare no better  being a rather sorry load of  rd raters .  br    br   the direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he  s also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers  shadow man  attack force  the screenplay co  written by seagal himself is laughably inept .  br    br   according to imdb    m was spent on this boring load of old tosh  if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent .  br    br   flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder  which has to be better than this tripe .  br    br   this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  give it a miss      out of   
but the fun is in the journey .  br    br   i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable  not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes  the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times .  br    br   yes  it  s predictable  and yes  it  s a clich romantic comedy . but the point is that it  s a sweet story  the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways .  br    br   the dialog is dead  on and the acting is well done on all parts  and over the top for comic effect . the bulgari scene is worth it  s weight in gold  the actress there deserves honorable mention  for those that panned it for being predictable  if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing . . . then you want a thriller . this is a romantic comedy . . . it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life  and it has been worth every effort along the way .  br    br   great date movie  great movie for a happy cry . . .  
as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel . his best was just fodder for bored teenagers . this one tips the scales  then falls off . the characters are all cardboard . the story is double lame . i can  t spoil it by telling you the ending . you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one . here goes . he is a super  dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide  instead of killing him  to dope his brain until he don  t remember squat . he escapes  of course  gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who  surprise  surprise  segal trained . all the heroes  except segal  s character and his dusky girlfriend  die heroically and steve  baby save the whole world in one swell foop  or fell swoop . whatever . made with some surplus air force and navy flying film . and a lot of boom  booms . get some popeye cartoons instead .  
this is a really old fashion charming movie . the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies . fi you want to watch a movie that doesn  t demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it . the acting is good  and i really liked michael rispoli . he was in rounders  too . and while you were sleeping . the rest of the cast is fun . it  s just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings . i know . . . sounds kooky . . . but it is . and that  s what makes it fun to watch . it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you  but at least you  ll know .  
steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close  up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources . to pick on the technical flaws  silver f  a    s and f    s take of from a carrier for an air  strike  and miraculously become camouflaged f    s for the actual strike  would give this movie more credibility than it deserves . suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe  which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro . putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu .  
as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known . the two leads always have to get together . late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together . a clue was given right from the start  but you  ll never realize it until the end . it  s a simple hook  but it works . it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground  but takes a fresh spin when ever possible . i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations . it  s a postcard of ny . also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it . so  if you like a good old fashion romantic movie . . . then this is for you .  
  flight of fury  is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film  i don  t expect a lot from a seagal film  all i expect is to be moderately entertained for   or so minutes with some mindless action  unfortunately this doesn  t even achieve that low expectation  the action scenes are few and far between  the plot  which is totally irrelevant in these films  is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout  the acting is truly abysmal  bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of  rd raters  i find it hard to believe that anything close to    m was spent on this dire mess unless    m of that   was seagal  s salary  i somehow doubt it  the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that  it  s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b  movies i  ve endured  br    br        
does anyone know the exact quote about  time and love  by george ede aka  father fitzpatrick in the move  it had to be you  he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving  if not i will have to rent the movie . this was a great movie . i also loved serendipity  great love story for the soul   br    br   i met my one true love  my soulmate  and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it  i wasn  t ready for that kind of emotional relationship .  br    br   altho  we did marry  i wasn  t mature enough to give as much as i thought i would . i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for  years .  br    br   he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry  in disbelief about the way it turned out . i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart  years .  br    br   this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love . i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me .  br    br   i know when he has healed enough to trust me again  we will remarry .  br    br   don  t ever get complacent and take true love for granted  it has been the hardest lesson of my life .  br    br   also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful  this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting . true love is worth waiting for  if it is meant to be  it will  no matter what  it will happen  nothing is impossible  even when it  s the second time around  thanks   
i usually don  t comment anything  i read the others opinions  . . . but this  this one i  have  to comment . . . i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action  f     and other hi  tech stuff  but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind . . . lousy acting  lousy script and a big science fiction .  br    br   it  s one of the worst movies i have ever seen . . .  br    br   simply . . . don  t bother . . .  br    br   and one more thing  before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site . . .  .  points and i give this movie a try  now i  m wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than  points            
i  d have given this film a few stars  simply because it was a  lifetime  presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here  new york city . most on this channel  whether  set  there  in rural iowa  oregon  virginia  l . a . etc .  are filmed in vancouver  ottawa  toronto or some other canadian locale .  br    br   but if there ever were one deserving the top rating     on this site  it  s this movie . certainly not for originality  for this story has been done many times  in many variations  with several very similar to this specific one . it  s also been done pretty often on the big screen  with mega  stars  past and present  from cary grant  james garner  harrison ford  tom hanks  et al  and deborah kerr  doris day  meg ryan  and many more . i can think of at least      more  just as prominent  past to present  off the top of my head  who could be added now  and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind .  br    br   not to drone on  but my point is that  in my opinion  this is by far one of the best of this genre i  ve seen . i caught it by chance on a mid  day friday  at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week . i  d never run across this flick in the  years since it was made . and  while the two leads have done enough to be known to most  they were completely unknown to me . the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman  anna  s mother  whom i  d seen in some things from her younger days  and michael rispoli  henry  charlie  s best friend  who was outstanding as  gramma   the menacing juice loan  tough  street guy from  rounders .   br    br   the chance meeting and coupling between both leads  best friends  as a sub  story romance  with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later  is an oft  done plot contrivance within the genre  but makes no difference to the enjoyment here  in fact  it enhances it  .  br    br   checking some other comments  i agree completely with those which are the most positive . the primary word describing this film is engaging  in caps . this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters  in whatever combination presented  and all of the supporting and even minor roles .  br    br   i love films with a  harder edge   rounders  the escapist schwarzenegger  stallone fare  goodfellows  even the classics like  casablanca    gone with the wind    citizen kane .  but for pure  uncomplicated enjoyment  this one was outstanding . with a bare fraction of their budgets  it was equal to the results achieved by  you  ve got mail  and  sleepless in seattle .  and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn  t have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the co  stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega  films  as well .  
following the appalling attack force  chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury . to out  stink attack force would take some doing . flight of fury is a marked improvement overall  but still in the grand scheme of thinks  mediocre . mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days  a sad insight into his movie career  s decline . where attack force was a hodge  podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception  to filming  to post production  flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple . someone steals a high  tech stealth fighter  planning to use it to fire chemical weapons  which we later  bizarrely discover  will destroy the whole world in   hrs  . seagal has to get the plane back . it  s that simple  no annoying sub  plots  and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works . that  s not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though  it  s pretty poor . the introduction to side characters is badly done for example .  br    br   in filmic terms fof is bad . it  s badly acted by all involved  and seagal looks bored to tears almost . he  s just got the look of a toddler who  s been forced to perform the school nativity against his will  and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness . can we blame seagal though when the material is so un  ambitious and cruddy  not really . this is the final film of his castel studio  s  multi  picture deal . the producers can  t be bothered to make anything remotely good  promising a   or so million dollar budget  and  after seagal  s obligatory  million  probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves  if the film was made for the remaining  million  then i  m elvis pressley   . so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that  s already got distribution sorted before it  s made . fan  s though may argue  he at least owes them the effort . he  s seriously looking jaded  and the continued use of stand ins and dub  overs is further indication of this . michael keusch directs with some efficiency  while the cinematography is quite good  but in all technical areas  and as usual with castel  a bog standard stunt team  there  s nothing more than mediocrity  and nothing to help the film rise above its material  and bored leading man . again there  s a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal  which in all truth we don  t want to see .  br    br   overall the action isn  t too bad . it  s nice and violent  and on occasion we  re treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings  but overall nothing special . partly due to a poor stunt crew  and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting . for me  shadow man was a more enjoyable film  because while ignoring the incoherent  jumbled  plot line  there were more vintage seagal moments  and more of him in centre stage . he never disappeared for long periods during the film . seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here  and re  appears after  with little explanation . there  s far too much stock footage used . using stock shots isn  t an entirely horrendous thing  but using it as a crutch is . we  re treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships  all the time  which get annoying . plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place  just check the backdrops  chopping and changing  .  br    br   the film is just middle of the road . it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless  and gratuitous girl on girl scene  with two hot chicks . seagal even perks up briefly then too  overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there  but that  s not saying much at all . this will please many fans  but they should bear in mind  seagal himself would probably want to forget this one  s existence .   
a sweet funny story of  people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings . the ex  cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting  even though they are marrying other people . maybe a little trite in that the  partners  are both type a personalities  while our protagonists are much more relaxed . not anything heavy  but it made me smile . and hey for the guys  sell the natasha henstridge angle  and the gals  sell them the sappy romance  everyone wins   
i can  t believe that steven segal  s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making  th rate films with  th rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .  br    br   the plot is unbelievable as a movie  and even if you excuse the visuals  and had read this story as a novel  you  d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .  br    br   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm  and in some scenes he doesn  t show up at all .  br    br   i hate to repeat other peoples comments  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .  br    br   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a   million dollar budget  segal being paid  of that  and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur .  br    br   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie  as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .  
it  s amazing that from a good  though not wonderful  film made back in the early nineties  a whole franchise can grow .  stargate sg   is  without a doubt  a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder  to  shoulder with  star trek  as the kings of sci  fi .  br    br   following on from the     feature film  stargate   this series sees stargate command  a military  science organisation  figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore . sg  is one such team  headed by military veteran colonel jack o  neill  and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson  military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal  c  who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people . earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa  uld  a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods .  br    br   the top  notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life . richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o  neill  who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye . michael shanks  as daniel  brings heart and an will of steel to the character  who has grown from wide  eyed innocence to darker and more hard  bitten as the show has progressed . amanda tapping  as carter  has perfected the balance between depicting her character  s femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong  intelligent military scientist . christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal  c  who is able to depict the character  s emotions with subtlety . and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness .  br    br   almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence  reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs  often shown through arguments between o  neill and jackson  . guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn  t bore viewers . sg  also excels in humour  from o  neill  s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd  sg  has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death . it isn  t just an excellent sci  fi show but is an excellent show  overall .  
timberlake  s performance almost made attack the screen . it wasn  t all bad  i just think the reporters role was wrong for him .  br    br   ll cool j played the typical rapper role  toughest  baddest guy around . i don  t think the cracked a smile in the whole movie  not even when proposed to his girlfriend .  br    br   morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie . he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie .  br    br   kevin spacey wasn  t good or bad he was just  there  .  br    br   overall it  s a dull movie . bad plot . a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors .  
sure  this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichs  but it  s entertaining  and that  s what i watch movies for . to be entertained . natasha henstridge is stunning  even with the short hair . her smile is radiant and her beauty can  t be disguised . as for michael vartan  i  m sure the women love him . the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film . i don  t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them . i guess we see what we want to see .  br    br   olivia d  abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch  even if d  abo  s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech . to tell you the truth i hadn  t really noticed it until i read these comments  but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me  but she was ideal for her role with that one exception .  br    br   it  s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others  but who find their soul mates in one another . it may be an unlikely story  but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries  it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube . that  s why we watch them  to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen . i thought these actors did a good job of it  but hey  i  m a sentimental guy who tears up easily . don  t get me wrong though  it has to be a sentimental scene  and this movie had plenty of those .  br    br   i give it     only because i  m saving my      for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day . if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies  or whatever  make a note to watch it . i think you  ll like it .  
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film  and be forced to play a part  mexican or he would have been suspended . believe me  he made the wrong choice  presumably  after the success of  dodge city   warners tried a follow  up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies  like alan hale  guinn  big boy  williams  frank mc hugh and the ever  present john litel  but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v . randolph scott  and as a singer to really make things bad  because she proved one thing  and that is she cannot sing . the story was not too bad  but with bogie clearly miscast also  it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong  and on a low budget  but in fairness  color would not have helped .  
a beautiful postcard of new york . the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear . it never did . my teenagers liked it too . my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan . my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something . this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done . the ending came with a twist which we all liked too . if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you . as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did . i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .  
it has been said   a city on hill cannot hide itself  and virginia city  nevada  perched on the side of mt . davidson at     ft . west of tahoe  is a prime example  or in the context of the movie  should be . virginia city exploded in the american dream as a shower of gold and silver  suspiciously the same year the civil war began . it was the birthplace of the dean of american letters it was where a young reporter named samuel clemens began using the name  mark twain  and went on to become america  s most famous writer . it was also the birthplace of the great hearst fortune  and the launching pad of john mackay  who became the wealthiest man in america  the third wealthiest man in the world . hey  they should have made the movie about him  in the      s virginia city was the boomtown of all boomtowns  the home of the big bonanza  at one time the largest  metropolitan  area west of st . louis and east of san francisco . but virginia city  the movie  misses all that and is more about a hogwash north  south duello between the characters played by errol flynn and randolph scott . flynn is capt . kerry bradford  a union officer who is a pow in a concentration camp run by a mean confederate commander named capt . vance irby  played by scott . these two are always getting in each other  s way . bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being  snuck  out of vc by who else other than . . . irby   hey  what  s he doing here    horrible . bogart plays a laughable mexican bandit who can  t decide who  s side he  s on . miriam hopkins plays a murky character named  julia hayne   obviously a historical lunge at the town  s first lady  julia bulette  who in real life a celebrated prostitute . she goes to washington and talks honest abe about saving bradford  not irby  from hanging and blah blah blah . go figure . they shoulda hung the writer . in  real life  twain reports that on the last day of the war  the setting sun caused the american flag atop mt . davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire  kind of like the movie . three days later they discovered that on that day the south capitulated . one interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks alan hale and guin williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot  like they  re fishing  or trying to make the bullets go faster . not a bad idea for the movie . the same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie . gosh  how could they miss the gold madness  profligate wealth  gun battles in the silver mines  mark twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown  the crooked railroad  the opera house fire  artemis ward  bulette  s huge funeral  the chinese tongs  the black saloons  the auction . .  all this high on a mountain surrounded by desert  the truth was unreal . did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great american holocaust  well  if you count this movie  it wouldn  t be the first debacle to come out of virginia city . it  s a disappointment for virginia city fans because it misses what made the town a  city of illusions   where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . okay  other than that it  s a fun movie . flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they  re destroying . if flynn would just play his rotten self i  d double my rating .  
i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work . finally found it yesterday        on lifetime movie channel .  br    br   jim larson  s comments about it being a  sweet funny story of  people crossing paths  were dead on . writers probably shouldn  t get a bonus  everyone else sro for making the movie .  br    br   anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it .  br    br   natasha  s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric  to say nothing of her beauty  that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for .  br    br   god bless her  her family and future endeavors .  br    br   this movie doesn  t seem to available in dvd or video yet  but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too .  
being a fan of cheesy horror movies  i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try . now that i  ve seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet . i get my movie rentals for free  and i feel that i didn  t get my moneys worth . i  ve seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time  hell i  m a fan of them  but this was just an insult .  
i caught this film at a test screening . was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story . well acted . natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts . the male lead was awsome . very funny film . takes place in the best locations in new york . made me want to go there . i just saw  you  ve got mail  i thought  it had to be you  was a much better story . fresher .  br    br   it was clean and great for whole family . i think it will do well . audience i saw it with loved it . a definite recommend   
slashers   outta  stars   br    br   not really a very good movie . . . but i did like the idea behind it . . . and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with . the movie is ostensibly an  episode  of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off  danger zone  and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them . the survivor  if there is one  wins fame and fortune . . . everyone else just winds up dead . the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad . none of the  real  people seem real at all . the actors playing the killers are kind of fun . . . because they are portraying cheesy and over  the  top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types . . . and that  s exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show . the movie pretends to be done all in one take . . . there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the  danger zone  and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera . . . but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly  to hide the  cuts  from one take to another  i would imagine  .  
this is the first michael vartan movie i  ve seen  i haven  t seen alias  and i was curious to see if the guy can act . he sure can and is likable in this movie . natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles  so i found her very good and lovable in this different  sweet  role of a schoolteacher . some of the negative comments i read are true  the movie is full of clichs and the story doesn  t ring true at all . also  even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together  i don  t think there is screen chemistry there . however  i enjoyed this movie . the locales are nice  the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good . if you are expecting to see a great romance  this is not it . but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good .  
how can this movie have a  .  this movie was a piece of skunk st . first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded . because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut  that happened to be about oh  quarter of an inch thick  that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood  and he did not even think he could cut threw it  second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with . the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t . v . show . bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of st they call a movie .  br    br   rating  .   
i just can  t understand the negative comments about this film . yes it is a typical boy  meets  girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by . henstridge  talk about winning the gene  pool lottery   is as magnetic and alluring as ever  who says the golden age of cinema is dead   and vartan holds his own .  br    br   there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene  lots  it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together . . .  br    br   ignore the negative comments  if you are feeling a bit blue  watch this flick  you will feel so much better . if you are already happy  then you will be euphoric .  br    br    ps i am    male  from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess . . .   
i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film . one thing i see  over and over  is annoyance with megan  the idealistic political scientist  trying to change the world . i loved her character . maybe  because i am a   year old political science student and i think i  m going to change the world too  so i relate to megan . besides  she  s cute . she  s no super model  but more of a cute girl next door .  br    br   ok  so she cried and screamed a lot . it  s very dramatic  and seems overdone  but doesn  t it fit her character  she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point . she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick . i think she made her argument very well . of course  being a young naive girl  she is terrified of what she is about to face . i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear . furthermore  i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in .  br    br   as for the movie in general  other than megan  it was pretty much what i expected . it had excellent gore scenes  by micro  budget standards . the plot maybe took a quick thought  hardly any contemplation . it  s basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film  which the name implies . i love the sadism of the doctor . he kept ripping megan  s shirt off  not just for the cause of sleaze  though largely so   but also to torment her  before he kills her . the chainsaw hick was hilarious . for slasher film lovers  he was probably the best character .  br    br   i give this film  out of   . it had a good setting  almost no plot  and a mix of good and terrible acting . i would recommend it for a cheap thrill  but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro  budget horror .  
this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than   why not  it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ . johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most  like our churches . the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it . great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans . at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians . thanks fox for producing it . as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece . movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves  in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright  honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith   
its spelled s  l  a  s  h  e  r  s . i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs . that was pretty tight . before and after that the movie pretty much blows . the acting is like e  list and it  s shown well in the movie . not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person . the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film . the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny . they said many stupid things that made me laugh . other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman  . anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated .  
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  adorned in black  of course  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also . if you like johnny cash  this film is quite enjoyable . also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work . . . just for fun  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair . . .  anyway  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .  
slashers . . . . . well if you like horrors its definitely one to see  otherwise don  t even bother . it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget  for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere  and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow  trust me you wont need to look for them . also try to ignore the cheesy actors  if thats what you call them   the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being  killers on the loose and whoever live  s at the end gets rich . now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days  for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would  nt mind having a go at this game  especially for    .    .    . so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind .  
johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories . the music is great  you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like  i  ve been there too   and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion . cash  s narration is good too .  br    br   but . . . .  br    br    . the actor who played jesus was miscast .  . there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music .  . because it is uncompelling  i doubt we  ll see this ever widely distributed again .  br    br   i  d love to buy the cd .  br    br   tom paine texas  usa  
i couldn  t help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon  a massively more amazing film  when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea . this could have been a great film . the acting is . . . from some of the actors alright . from others . . . it  s downright horrible .  br    br   that aside the idea is great and the format is great . the story is pretty good as well  though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind .  br    br   nevermind that though right  it is a horror movie after all .  br    br   i really want to see this remade . . . i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be .  br    br   however  and you can  t really fault the minds behind the movie for this  this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget . and the fx really hurt the film overall .  br    br   great movie . . . . if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx .  br    br   whoever wrote it should keep going though  great idea here .  
there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years . the gospel road was one of them . i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again . my favorite parts were the fact that  br    br     jesus was blond   br    br     the last supper was a huge meal   br    br     he liked playing with the children   br    br     his death was for all people and for all time .  br    br   the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting  but it touched my heart at that time . besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture . if it ever comes out on dvd  i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons .  
more wide  eyed  hysterical   s hyper  cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti  social  pathological behaviour . danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy .  br    br   it  s a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead  or in nursing homes  . i kinda thought about suing them for torture . as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor  defenseless ear  drums  i felt instant  strong pain envelop my entire being . that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits  nevermind glass .  br    br    why didn  t you switch the channel if you didn  t like it    you might ask angrily . fair point  fair point . . . the answer is that i wanted to  but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor  writhing in agony . with my last ounces of energy  i tried to reach the remote but couldn  t .  br    br   a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven  who then proceeds to  pigmalionize  him . lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson  but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up . this may seem like a rather thin plot  but this noisy movie is so chock  full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all . this movie is relentless . forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer  s  reign in blood   as in a south park episode  . whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange   s musical world  it  s all infantile  as if they were all  year  olds impersonating grown  ups . i can only envy people who find movies like this funny . it must be great being easy  to  please what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious  gut  busting comedy .  br    br   but let  s examine this phenomenon  the   s musical . my best guess is that   s musicals offered the more day  dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven  depending on whether you  re church  going or lenin  s  tomb  going   or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy  inspired places . ttono is more akin to a representation of hell  but that  s just me . i don  t seem to  get  musicals . people talk  there is a story  but then all  of  a  sudden everyone starts singing for about  minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened  when you think about it  musicals are stranger than any science  fiction film .  br    br   worse yet  ttono  my favourite type of pizza  btw  is not just a   s musical  but one with opera squealing . opera is proof that there is such a thing as over  training a voice  to the point where it becomes an ear  piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure . the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet . i tried lowering the volume . i lowered it from   to   . then from   to   . then  . i ended up lowering it to a   which is usually so low that it  s only heard by specially  trained dogs and certain types of marsupials  and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys   br    br   take the scene in the small boat in the river . danza starts off with one of his deafening  brain  killing tunes  and then . . . nothing . no animals anywhere to be seen . even the crocodiles  who are mostly deaf  have all but left . if you look carefully  you might even see the trees change colour  from green to yellow  in a matter of minutes . no  this was not a continuity error  it was plain old torture of the flora . and those trees were just matte paintings  imagine how real trees would have reacted .  br    br   the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency  but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self  explosion . i can listen to the loudest  least friendly death metal band for hours  but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache .  
i wait for each new episode  each re  run with anticipation  the new look of sci  fi created by stargate sg   is a wonder that i hope will never end . to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me . season   should be a thrill in itself . i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o  neill . the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner  season after season . you cancel this program in the next three years  and you make a serious mistake . also  you need a bigger role for the asgard  they are just too cool .  
pathetic . . . worse than a bad made  for  tv movie . i can  t believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick . for some reason morgan freeman  s character is constantly talking about and saying  pussy  when referring to nsync boy  s girlfriend . morgan freeman calling women  pussy  is just awkward . . . what the hell were the people behind this film thinking  too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting  confusing camera angles  a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable .  br    br   i rented this flop with low expectations . . . . but . . . well . . . it really sucked .  
i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b  rated movie . i came out surprised and very amused . eva was good  but lake bell stole the show . she had amazing comedic timing . the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between . the plot was enough to tie it all together  a woman  eva  dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was  to  be husband  its sounds far  fetched but it actually works quite well .  br    br        overall its a worthwhile cinema watch  if not get it on dvd when it comes out .  
a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza  s mgm contract at the time .  br    br   as reported by member lastliberal  above  grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off  and sometimes on  camera . in addition  his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable . after doing their second  and last  film together   toast of new orleans   the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b . mayer  s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again  period . mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza  so grayson  s statement stuck . grayson went on to star in a number of widely received  and far more profitable  musicals with howard keel and others . later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them  and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the  real people  in the audiences .  
i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say  it was very  very good . on all fronts script  cast  director  photography  and high production values  etc . proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom  com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston  who mug and call it acting . who  da thunk it   br    br   parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as  over her dead body .  lake bell is excellent  too  and this is the first time i have seen her . and finally  paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie  instead of lesser films .  br    br   a movie like this never gets its dues from close  minded males . it  s too bad . as other imdb reviewers here have noted  there is nothing lame about this gem   no hack writing or acting .  br    br   and its depiction of contemporary l . a . and california  in general  makes every scene look bright  beautiful  clean  and otherwise outstanding in every way . never before has a movie made l . a . look so good . ah  what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie .  br    br   i won  t divulge the plot  but as a long  time and hard  core atheist  i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light  hearted piece of entertainment . it reminds me very much of the old  topper  movies  which were also so enjoyable .  br    br   this movie exposes popular  but otherwise hackneyed  movies like  ghost  for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are . we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre . some of us save our praise for the truly worthy  however .  br    br   if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as  into the night  with michelle pfeiffer  jeff goldblum and clu gulager   blind date  with bruce willis and kim basinger   american dreamer  with jobeth williams   chances are  with robert downey jr .  christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard   making mr . right  with john malkovich  etc .  you  ll enjoy this .  br    br   a first  rate job all around  even if it  s kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years .  but even that plot device doesn  t detract from the movie  s overall excellence .  
i really didn  t expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv  which is were i live  acting in it . this town is dull and so is this film . there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show . this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn  t any . unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday  then stay away from this movie . the dialog will put you to sleep  the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this . its a predictable movie with no surprises . what you see is what you get and that is a   minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator .  
ah  i loved this movie . i think it had it all . it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times . yes  i am a girl  so i  m writing this from a girl  s perspective . i think it  s a shame it only scored  .  in rating . too many guys voting  it was far above other romantic comedies . just because i  m female i don  t enjoy all chic flicks  on the contrary i prefer other genres . romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be . but like i said  this movie had it all  almost  in my opinion . great script  good one  liners  fine acting . although eva longoria parker  s character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives  but so what  it was awesome . i will keep this film for rainy days  days when i feel low and need a few laughs .  
this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california . she thought it was wonderful because it was so real   just the way people in the ohio valley are   i  m from the area and i experienced the film as  just the way people in california think we are   i  ve lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there . we laughed a lot  we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night . the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families . the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else .  br    br   aside from the  if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed  condescension  the story lacked any elements of charm  mystery or even a sense of dread .  br    br   martha  s character was the worst drawn . it  s doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church  but if she had  she probably would have made friends there . i  ve read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was  younger  prettier and thinner  but if this is the case it isn  t shown . all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender . we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions  left out of the loop when social plans are made  used but not appreciated  and finally disrespected and hurt .  br    br   just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks  please . this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level .  
this had a good story . . . it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool .  br    br   i  ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i  ve seen in the two weeks .  br    br   jason bigg  s character was the best though .  br    br   even though it was small  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning .  br    br   this may be a romantic comedy and i don  t like most  but the writing  direction  performing  sound  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool .  br    br   this film scored pretty high out of all the movie  s i  ve seen lately  and the rest were big budget or better publicized .  br    br   good job in writing .  
when thinking of the revelation that the main character in  bubble  comes to at films end  i am reminded of last years  machinist  with christian bale . the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters .  br    br   an understated  yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . the title is cause for contemplation . perhaps  we  the audience are the ones in the  bubble  as we are given no payoffs in the films slim   minute running time . audience reactions were often smug and judgmental  clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves . these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w . back in office for a second term .  br    br   it  s sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role . this film has it  s merits  and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn  t say outright .  
this is a great film .  br    br   i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this . i had never heard of it or anyone in it  excpet mike from friends  .  br    br   but it is great  eva  lake and paul give amazing performances . the humour is consistently dry and witty .  br    br   paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends  which works great  . the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic  i mean we are not talking  apocalypse now  here  but the characters are likable  the story is engaging  the soundtrack  production and direction all work well .  br    br   in all a great feel  good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets .  br    br   everyone has their own tastes but i really don  t understand the one star reviews for this .  
i just saw this at the venice film festival  and can  t quite decide about it . we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them . maybe that was the point  that we are all in a  bubble  of our own  but these people didn  t compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates . at a running time of just over an hour  the characters weren  t very well developed . lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment  forklifts  conveyor belts  shovels   and the slightly  creepy  looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes  that most of the characters made for a living  were somehow more interesting than the live people . an interesting experiment  but somehow it never quite came together .  
actually my vote is a  .  . anyway  the movie was good  it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it  don  t misunderstand me  is not the funniest movie of the world  and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies  but this one has its own taste  a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends . . . i think that not exactly but who cares  also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic  chris rock appears in it  the name is down to earth  men  that one its a very funny movie  see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr . rock won with his movie . i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher  however  the film is good .  
san francisco is a big city with great acting credits . in this one  the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city . they didn  t even manage the most basic of realistic details . so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie . you will not be thinking  oh  i  ve been there   you will be thinking  how did a two story firetrap  stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby   some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations . it detracts  but the acting was always competent .  br    br   the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles  at least in the beginning . the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting . the plot is weak  ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies . the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance  they were framed and paced better . but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries .  br    br   the white boy intro was pointless . i think the filmmakers didn  t know what to do with it  so they left it loosely structured and cut it down . the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal  really  folks  everyone knows it  s not  groovy  to live in the ghetto  but his segments are the most humorous . they threw away some good opportunities . educated and embittered on the west coast  a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york . they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable . that would have been interesting this was not .  br    br   the hunter  s point intro was the most disappointing . it was the most derivative of the three  and stylistically the most distant from san francisco . you  ve seen it done before and you  ve seen it done better . even the video game was better   br    br   despite the generic non  locality and aimless script  these characters have potential  the actors have talent  and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction . . . about ten minutes before the ending . good concept placed in the wrong hands .  br    br   ps  there is a missing minority here  see if you can guess which one .  
i watched this on an  hour flight and  presumably because of the pressure and the altitude  i actually found it mildly entertaining  emphasis on the  mild   .  br    br   the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies  her fianc falls in love with someone else  she decided to make sure they don  t get together  but eventually she lets them do it . sadly the actual film wasn  t as good . ok  there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well . but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on . i think the whole gay  but  not  gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better . the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn  t really very funny .  br    br   in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me  but it was a close call .  
if he wanted to be accurate  he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free  not sucker free  . i  ve lived in sf my entire life  and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did . everything was over  dramatized  and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper . no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here  ie his warriors jersey  . not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or  ers gear instead he fitted them in some cheesy made  up sf or oakland jerseys that aren  t even sold around here . hp has no bowling alleys  black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china  s olympic team  nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops . further  while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission  all that was shown was some white dude and a self  proclaimed      west coast boriqua .  this is not new york  puerto ricans here are few and far between  and the latinos in the mission are very  very different from the one that was shown here  who was without a doubt from ny . also  hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city . an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs . fillmore  sunnydale  lakeview  etc .  br    br   this film could  ve been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with .  
i wasn  t a fan of seeing this movie at all  but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics .  br    br   overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much . this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in   days and just like heaven . a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess . the movie was quite short though  around   min .  but it was enough to tell the whole story  build some character development and have a decent happy ending . the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow . eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast  especially jason biggs  kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace .  br    br   overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating . hey its a chick flick and i  m reviewing this movie from a guy  s persepctive alright  it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it .  
this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist . the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst  k . it  s super bowl at the superdome in new orleans . however  no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing . with the many stars in this film  it made no difference . i really don  t know why i watched this .  
look it  s eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend . it  s gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore  sex panther cologne  in anchorman . if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies . however  if you are willing to suspend reality for   minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you  ve come to the right place . the characters are all funny . they work together very well . the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell . he  s as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time . i went with my wife  she enjoyed it and so did i .  
superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made . the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl  and all the attempts made to stop them . how tom selleck and donna mills  careers managed to survive this is beyond me . however  the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all  avoid this one if possible .  
over her dead body was a nice little movie . it was decent and entertaining  while still being pretty funny . there were a few clich  s  but i found most stuff fresh . at first i didn  t think it was going to be good at all  when it started out . if you can get past the first   minutes though  the movie starts getting more interesting . this film wasn  t burst out in laughter hilarious  and wasn  t oh my gosh wonderful . it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was . i don  t see how this movie was bad . it  s rating is just a bit too low . i could  ve dealt with a  .   but a  .   also  giving this movie a  is disgraceful . it was pretty good  and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a   which is what most people gave it .  
it  s      and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well  fans will be upset and certainly the       seats will be full  only less happy there are so many black players on the field  this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable . it  s not much more  but it  s really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance  for the time   probably most notably tom selleck . unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen  is quickly trumped by  actors  like dick butkus .  br    br   it  s a silly story about super bowl betting . pj jackson is charged by  new york   read mafia  for ensuring the game ends for their favor  in this case a            bet . pj is innocent enough  and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there . but things seem to fall apart for him . another person  the unsuspected lainie  takes charge . for a while  the mystery of murders isn  t known for certain  but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist .  br    br   it  s a bad movie  but is watchable . the acting is decent  and the filming is ok . at least there weren  t any silly typical   s car chases  they have their place just not here  . just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you  ll survive .  br    br        maybe a  .    
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full   vote if claudia black had not continued on in it  her inclusion as the silly  vela  has brought the series down in my estimation . to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake .  br    br   unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of  jack  and really didn  t need this great series turned into new episodes of  farscape  .  br    br   i was a great fan of the film  stargate  and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film  but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked . i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation  
the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script  but it is watchable . what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies  and on top of that for movies like this one . i have to admit i had never heard the man  s name before watching this  but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed . the voice is crap  the face is a bad rip  off of legolas  the posture is horrible  and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them . said to say  i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco  because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only . too bad i was wrong . these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance  and they are the main reason i give this a  .  br    br   i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast . . . and cannot believe it .  
in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review  this film actually was surprisingly good  i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichs  obvious jokes and overacting  all of which the trailer had promised .  br    br   however  after  minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . with only one  toilet humour  gag  over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and  without spoiling anything too much  some of the moments involving animals are hilarious .  br    br   the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script  director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy  this film stands tall .  br    br   sure  you aren  t going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening  but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time   
the championship game is only a couple of days away  but things in new orleans aren  t as they should be . from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose  life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable  wonderful time . can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined   br    br   despite what you might think when you first read about superdome  this is not a football movie . in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought . instead  superdome is another of those lousy soap opera  ish   s made  for  tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be . the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good . the best  or worst  example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he  s there . the plot is dull  uninteresting  and unbelievable . donna mills as a hit  man   yeah  right  it  s about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen . the movie also lacks any pace . trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had . with no drama or suspense in sight  superdome ends up being a very poor example of a   s made  for  tv movie . the lone highlight for me was the voice  over work from the late charlie jones  a sportscaster i miss listening to . the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over  hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest .  br    br   like most others who have seen superdome  i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater     . it may be one of the ktma public access episodes  but it  s one of the best examples of the shows early start . so even though i  ve only rated superdome a      i  ll give this episode a generous    on my mst  k rating scale .  
once when i was in college and we had an international fair  the russian section had a soviet  era poster saying  ne boltay    meaning  don  t gossip   . i  translated  it for the  generation  of tv watchers as  don  t be gladys kravitz    in reference to the nosy neighbor on  bewitched   .  br    br   however  when you see the result of gossip in the pvt . snafu short  rumors   you see that it  s not quite a laughing matter . in this case  the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states . so  he tells it to someone  who tells someone else  who tells someone else  and it continues . as in  the russians are coming  the russians are coming   the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time  so that when it gets back to snafu . . . well  you know what i mean  yes  it  s mostly wwii propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the japanese  but i have to say that the pvt . snafu shorts were actually quite funny . of course  since they had dr . seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices  it  s no surprise that these came out rather cool . worth seeing .  
comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic . speaking of timeliness  there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie . they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong . there were sly reference such as  they paved paradise to put up a parking lot  . the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan .  br    br   the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers . almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie . very little of what the characters said were believable . combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail . although  there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and  despite what another reviewer said  rick shroeder was quite good . showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in  n . y . p . d . blues  .  
friz freleng  s  rumours  is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic  inducing rumours during wartime . produced  as were all the snafu shorts  to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films   rumours  is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan . when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing  it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war . this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long  rubbery piece of baloney and several strange  fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country  s military .  rumours  is inventive  fast paced and funny  all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured   don  t badmouth the military  message . it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts .  
when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie  i was like  score  i admit  i was eager to see the movie . and i have to say  the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way . then it went all down hill . i didn  t expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo . they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story . i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort  especially his role . nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war . if anyone really wants to know how communism was like  sit down and read a book on it . and not one that praises it or is against it  just the cold hard facts .  br    br   i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky  s body  but that was all that interested me . everything else about this movie irritated me .  
rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  private snafu .  the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed  animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros .  termite terrace  including friz freleng  chuck jones  and carl stalling . the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu  and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel  i . e . dr . seuss . the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery  using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope  the little twerp who would do everything you  re not supposed to do . according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials  but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes  certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow   all for the greater good  of course .  br    br   as the title would indicate  this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors . the setting is an army camp . private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine  something you won  t see in any other hollywood films of the era  and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling . we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted  then exaggerated  then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp . the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot  while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air  i . e  balloon juice .  a soldier  shoots his mouth off   cannon  style  and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction . winged baloney  at that . panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized  coney island wiped out  enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn  and the japanese are in california . the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for  rumor  itis  and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell .  br    br   this is a highly effective piece of work . the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy  and the message is still a valid one . in recent years we  ve seen that catastrophic events  real or imagined  can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances . because the technology has improved  the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e  mail  cellphones and blogging . consequently  rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn  t feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever .  
no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie . it  s just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch . bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction . students fist  fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue . the watts riots with a cast of . . . ugh . . .     dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look  alike with the most annoying smile since  mr . sardonicus  . noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift . drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service . silly  giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of  shindig   sing horribly off key  and actually make it big in the music business . and who wrote this compelling dialog    i  m going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair  . . . .  i think i found someone to buy stick  s woody   . . . .  these people are  animals     these people are my  family   as the shirelles sing  mama said  . oh brother  what a mess . this is like a  reefer madness  of the    s except it  s not even funny .  
this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors . these were called  instructional  cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny  looking main character called  pvt . snafu .   br    br   all of us have imaginations  along with fears and what  have  you  and that  s what happens here as pvt . snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with  five .  you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them . that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause  as pointed out here in this cartoon . a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy . that  s still being done today .  br    br    we lost the war   declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon . amazing how some americans still haven  t learned . this cartoon may be   years old but it sure has relevance today . as i write this  there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the  war on terror  is just a bumper sticker slogan . amazing .  br    br   the writer  the famous  dr . suess   uses analogies of  hot air balloon juice  here to present the above message . with theodore geisel  his real name  you know the rhymes will be clever .  br    br   nothing hilarious here  but it wasn  t meant to be . you have to understand the climate of     and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii . people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning . it was a tense time  
i saw this back in    when it was finally released . apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy  i think  the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier .  br    br   i have problem remembering details partly because i haven  t seen it in a long time  but i do remember it as a very dull movie . i kept debating whether to walk out of it . the store was not at all interesting or engaging . was a  rd rate america graffiti imitation .  br    br   none of the performances make it worth watching either . one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating .  
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original  the vanishing   spoorloos  it does have the same overall feel  except for that koolhoven  s style is less business  like and more lyric . the beginning is great  the middle is fine  but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film  but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit  but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films can  t be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject   de grot  stays always within the boundaries of good taste .  de grot  tells an amazing story stretched over more than   years . when you  ll leave the cinema you  ll be moved . what can we ask more of a film  anyway  this film even gives more . . . .  
couldn  t go to sleep the other night . so i got up  flipped on the tube  this movie was on .  br    br   film makers bit off more than they could chew . just as ambitious in scope as  forrest gump  was . but gump read like an fairy  tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era . tgmb just relies on tired clichs to tell the story . almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up . every character  s purpose was to fill a silly    s archetype .  br    br   take how we  re introduced to finnegan hugging his black maid  receiving a framed picture of mlk . criminey  talk about heavy  handed . why not just give him a t  shirt saying  i heart black people    br    br   sunshine  isn  t free love groovay  man  oh no  i didn  t have my period .   br    br   mary beth  i want to go to berkeley  not square ucla .  uh  excuse me  there was nothing square about la in the   s . rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique  we just hear this brat whine about not going there .  br    br   can  t even remember the black kid  s name . he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are .  br    br   thing is  period pieces don  t have to be this cheesy . take  dazed  confused .  look how we  re introduced to the football hero  randall floyd . we don  t first see him on the football field . in fact  we never see him play football . we  re introduced to him in class  inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party .  br    br   in  dazed  feminism isn  t a casual by  product of some chick getting knocked up . it  s much more organic  more serious than that . it  s refined in the ladies  room over a flip discussion about gilligan  s island . serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings . but real life is like that .  br    br   some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant . i agree  which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby  boomer pornostalgia .  
tim krabbe is the praised author of  het gouden ei   a novel that was put on the screen twice   spoorloos  and  the vanishing   . one of the dutch writer  s more recent works is  de grot   a psychological thriller about two totally different men  egon and axel  who meet at a youth camp and  surprising enough  become friends for dear life . egon is a quiet  somewhat dull person  who spends his time studying and writing geography books . axel  on the other hand  is a charismatic  party  animal   a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday  s concern is to get a woman into his bedroom . from the moment they meet  axel has a strong influence on egon  while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything  such as reading thick books like egon   ultimately  egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself  which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country .  br    br   after having read the book last year  i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it . in my opinion  the book suffers especially from the complex structure . while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people  the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically  so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode . because of this  the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character  s background to really care for him or her . another complaint was the fact that the main characters  egon and axel  are a little stereotypical . egon is  the  dull intellectual  while axel is his exact opposite . in real life  such one  dimensional people rarely exist in books and films  they always seem to be there  taking away a lot of credibility .  br    br   despite all this  the film was a pleasant surprise  being much better than the book . the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography  humour and acting fedja van huet  egon  is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting  which is  in my opinion  the highest an actor can achieve  . the drawbacks of the film  however  are the same as the book  s mainly because the characters are one  dimensional  they are so predictable that it becomes annoying . guess who wrote the script  indeed  krabbe himself . it is obvious that this talented director  that  s what the movie makes clear anyway  is hampered by a deficient screenplay . perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book .  br    br        
major league back to the minors         br    br   starring scott bakula  eric bruskotter  corbin bernsen  dennis haysbert  jensen daggett  written and directed by john warren    minutes rated pg     for language and some violence   br    br   by blake french  br    br   believe it or not  in the new john warren comedy  major league back to the minors  there is one funny scene . it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face . it  s not much  but with the exception of a few one  liners  it  s all this film has to offer . . . enough said .  br    br   this movie is not only structurally impaired  characteristically undeveloped  predictable and badly written  but also just plain bad . even non  critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got . it is so familiar it just isn  t funny .  br    br   how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made  last years we saw this same material in  air bud golden receiver   and as bad as that film was  this is even worse . at least  air bud  was family oriented .  major league back to the minors  is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon . it is too childish for adults . so who is this film for  teenagers  elderly  people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this   br    br   the film  like many others like this  has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all . yes it does  and what a great moral to try to prove . too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes . where the silly announcers form their own  buddy comedy routine  muttering one liners to themselves like  they suck    this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass    this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost   maybe it was his mind    somebody needs a nap   and  ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play .  where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name . and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny .  br    br     major league back to the minors  is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence . the good baseball team is on a comeback  they are about to win and   the power goes out . i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion  but in reality  its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time . the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny . there is another kind  of  funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer . the coach  s answer  you  re too old  too slow  and too fat .  the player  s reaction is to die for . but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time  and certainly is not worth a cent of your money .  br    br   so here is another dreadful entre into this genre of film  another that is doomed with its own script  which is failed before seen  and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again .  br    br    
  de grot  is a terrific dutch thriller  based on the book written by tim krabb . another of his books   het gouden ei  was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called  spoorloos    the vanishing   in     . this one is not as good as that thriller  although much better than the american remake also called  the vanishing   but there are times it comes close .  br    br   especially the opening moments are terrific . we see a man  later we learn his name is egon wagter  fedja van hut   coming from a plane in thailand . when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border . these scenes are perfectly directed  photographed and acted . a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this . later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman  both stating that they have never done anything like this .  br    br   from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash  forward . we see how egon  still as a child  here played by erik van der horst   befriends a guy named axel  as a kid played by benja bruijning  . we learn how they grew up as friends  sort of  and how axel  as an adult played by marcel hensema  became a criminal . egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman . around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him .  br    br   the movie is chronological in a way . it shows egon and axel as kids  than as students  young adults  and in their mid  thirties . but from time to time  like i said  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again . every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults .  br    br   minor spoilers herein .  br    br   the title means  the cave   and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending  although it is in fact not that happy . like the beginning  the ending is terrific . the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes  only to come back at that point in the end . it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well .  
this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen  the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film . i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame   
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original  the vanishing   spoorloos  it does have the same overall feel  except for that koolhoven  s style is less business  like and more lyric . the beginning is great  the middle is fine  but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film  but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit  but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films can  t be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject   de grot  stays always within the boundaries of good taste .  de grot  tells an amazing story stretched over more than   years . when you  ll leave the cinema you  ll be moved . what can we ask more of a film  anyway  this film even gives more . . . .  
how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel  all it does is throw balls  worst of all  it doesn  t compare to even the first installment of the series  the comedy suffers from not being funny . where did all the unintentional laughter go  enough slapstick on  the  field action goes on too long . bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine  inning shutout . what  s next  major league   return to the little league  ehh  could be  leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all  star game . this one  s had three strikes too many .  
de grot is a very good film . the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb  who also adapted this story for the screen . some really top  class acting  not only by van hut  but especially by marcel hensema  who mostly did tv  work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf . the film seems to kick of as a thriller  and sets an excellent mood . then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash  back structure  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character  driven drama of the movie . in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending  that will grab audiences by their throats . make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie . a must  see  especially if you liked  spoorloos   the vanishing  s original screen adaptation  .  
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can  t believe they dumped cleveland .  yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league  but still be consistent .  anyway i loved the first major league  liked the second  and always looked forward to the third  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can  t tell me this wasn  t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don  t watch this junk .  
i started watching the show from the first season  and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it . original movie was kind of childish  and i was just looking for some sci  fi show while waiting for the bsg new season .  br    br   but after few episodes i became a fan . i  ve loved the characters  the not  so  stupid  as  you  think  he  is jack o  neill  the not  only  smart samantha carter  the glorious teal  c  women and kids favorite  and brilliant dr . daniel jackson .  br    br   of course  stories sometimes not serious  sometimes even ridiculous  but mostly it  s not about technology or space fighting  it  s about helping your friend  even risking your life for him . it  s about  we don  t leave anybody behind  . struggling to the end when all hope is lost . about the free will  and all good qualities that makes a human  human .  br    br   and now it  s breaking a record  going   th season  and still doing good .  
oh dear god . this was horrible . there is bad  then there was this . this movie makes no sense at all . it runs all over the map and isn  t clear about what its saying at all . the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman . the fact that  edison  isn  t a real city  takes away . since i live in vancouver  watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable . why didn  t they make it a real city  the only writing that was decent was  tilman  in which john heard did a fantastic job . he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy . it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time  and the movie be a washout . too bad . hopefully someone important will see it  and at least give john heard credit where credit is due  and hire him as lead bad guy again  which is where he should be . on the a list .  
indian directors have it tough  they have to compete with movies like  laggan  where   henpecked  castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots .  devdas   a hapless  fedar  festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion  with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one  s feelings or sentiments  alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry . but to make a good movie  you have to tight  rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum  dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit  bollywood  leading actor who is marginally handsome . so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words  defending his village  this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar  narasimhan  . nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him  meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson . this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india . nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films . the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with songdances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won  t sell  a sad but true state of affairs . faster this changes better for  bollywood  . all said and done this is one good movie .  
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can  t believe they dumped cleveland .  yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league  but still be consistent .  anyway i loved the first major league  liked the second  and always looked forward to the third  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can  t tell me this wasn  t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don  t watch this junk .  
i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought  hey  another film starring aishu and shah rukh  little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just   minutes . shakti is a film about a mother  s love and endurance . it  s a film about transformations  ignorance  coming of age  stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life . the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie . it  s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk  s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze . he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day  dressed scantily and begins to seduce him . the title of the song is  ishq kamina   loosely translated as  love  s a bitch    and it is just plain smoking hot  don  t miss it .  
this movie is so bad it  s funny . it stars scott backula as some coach  but that  s not important  what is important is the large black fellow who plays  st base . first off he has to be at least   years old  yet still plays minor league baseball  second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk  let alone run . coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time . backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film   spoiler   he tells his star player  downtown  to hit a home run  clearly  downtown  viewed this as a good move . he hit the home run and won the game for his team  a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie . now if only tony muser  manager of the royals  would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat  the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game .  
good movie  good music  good background and an acceptable plot . but the main point again as his movies tend to be  the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold . nana patekar . this may be his second best performance after parinda  others may disagree  . although other movies are not far behind . one man that will never ever disappoint you .  br    br   good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without . you can see in his movies  others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins . but this man is really something elase .  br    br   the movie is cool  the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good . a must watch .  
okay  just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie . well  at least i did . it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour . spoiler  br    br   it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants . the only problem is that her daughter  s friend is the girl in the way . she always wins the competitions  therefore pushing the mother further towards  eliminating  her . after talking to a  hitman   the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit . so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught .  br    br   the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening . don  t waste your time watching this .  br    br    
this is probably karisma at her best  apart from zubeidaa . nana patekar also gives out his best  without even trying . the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag  especially when shahrukh comes in the picture . what really made me like it were the performances of the leads  the dialog delivery  as well as the story  for what it was . it could  ve been directed better  and edited . the supporting case was even great  including karima  s mother in law  even though she just had one shining moment  it was great to watch her .  br    br   the sets were also pretty good . i didn  t really like their portrayal of a canadian family  but once they step in india  it  s as real as it gets .  br    br   overall  i would give it a thumbs up   
this is one very dire production . the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal  she was a very beautiful young woman . here was the production  s weakest point  the actress failed to get that across . it also appeared that the production budget couldn  t stretch to a hairdresser  from the outset  the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush . the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical .  br    br   the production was a flaw ridden  clich ridden  embarrassing load of rubbish . i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas   
a strong woman oriented subject after long  director krishna vamsi  s shakti  the power  the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi  s first home  production . a story about a woman  s fight against harsh injustice .  br    br   the story of the film revolves around nandini  karisma kapoor  who lives in canada with her two uncles  tiku talsania  jaspal bhatti  . there she meets shekhar  sanjay kapoor   falls in love with him and they soon marry . their family is complete when nandini has a boy  raja  master jai gidwani  . but their happiness is short lived  as the news of shekhar  s ailing mother  deepti naval  makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india . and that  s when the problems start . from the moment they reach  br    br   india  both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere . they take a crowded train to reach shekhar  s village and when they finally reach the station  they have to catch a long bus drive to his village . the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never  ending drive . and unfortunately for them  a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus . fortunately  they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him . after that  they drive to the handing havel where shekhar   s father  narsimha  nana patekar  lives with his wife  deepti naval  . nandani realized that her father  in  law is in command as soon as she enters the place  but her only solace is her mother  in  law  s warm welcome .  br    br   living there  nandini learns of her father  in  laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him . the day she sees her father  in  law teach her son to throw a bomb  she loses it and lashes out against him  insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada . but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day  leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father  in  law . her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart  wrenching film .  br    br   what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie . the only drawback is ismail darbar   s music  which fails to rise above the script . the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena  which has been composed by anu malik . another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast . karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother . she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal . second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film . his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he  s shown his versatility once again with this role . sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors . deepti naval too is in top form and her pr  climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy . shahrukh  s cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he  s been pulled in to get the required star value . though his role was not really required  he  s done it well . overall  shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr  release hype is sure to get it a good opening . shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up . so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least  reels to better the impact . shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch   
for months i  ve been hearing about this little movie and now i  ve seen it . i find it cute  cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people  s creative ideas in order to make their own one  joke premise of a movie . troops  swingblade  any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind . if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood  s door then they  re doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films . how many times have you heard the phrase   it  s animal house meets back to the future    it  s wall street meets dead poet  s society   or  shakespeare in love meets star wars   i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable .  
seeing this movie was the most fun i  ve had at the cinema in a long time . however  i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film  because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied . this picture has everything any movie could ever have . it has characteristics of a romantic comedy  a political commentary  a thriller  a drama  an action movie  a musical  and an absurdist self  conscious art film . it  s all in there  adding up to a myth .  br    br   the basic premise is about an indian couple  nandini  karishma kapoor  and shekhar  sanjay kapoor   happily living in canada  who rush to india to visit the husband  s parents after a disturbing news report . the rest of the story takes place in india  where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence . at one point  the story borrows from  not without my baby   but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice .  br    br   the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions  including shah rukh khan  s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie . in fact  the two stars are on all the posters  but they appear really late in the film  and only shah rukh ends up being a real character . yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance .  br    br   karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film  and she does an admirable job  having to link up the film  s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion . another notable presence is nana patekar  who plays narsimha  the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar . nana patekar dominates every scene he  s in with a scary but nuanced character .  br    br   the movie is not without its share of realism . violence is rampant  but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters  with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions . at times  this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic .  br    br   i have seen a share of bollywood releases  and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm . but  shakti  raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous . it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy  where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained . it is pure  gratuitous cinema  and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book . perhaps  the all  important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind  but i came out of watching  shakti  exhilarated . making movies can be the most fun in the world   
way back in      a certain director had no idea about a galaxy  far away or near . he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc . this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george . i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it . this is merely an advertising promo for the director  actors  et . al . it has little intrinsic artistic value . it is a brochure . the lead playing george  is very fine  as is the leia character  and the ersatz darth character . all else is plain commercial dross . what a waste . still  it got the job done i guess . the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess . a brochure only .  
okay  i know this does  nt project india in a good light . but the overall theme of the movie is not india  it  s shakti . the power of a warlord  and the power of a mother . the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth . then things go terribly wrong . the interaction between nandini and her father in law  the power of their dysfunctional relationship  and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie . shah rukh khan  s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor . it is easy to get caught up in the love  violence and redemption of lives in this film  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax . the musical interludes are strengths  believable and well done .  
where  s michael caine when you need him  i  ve seen most of the many seasons of mst  k  but this rare pre   st season flick  episdoe k     is easily one of the worst movies ever made . three  stars   lee majors  chris makepeace and burgess meredith  struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever  delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheney  style workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research . looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness  possibly on super  . makes logan  s run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare . i can  t imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since it  s unwatchable even with it . clearly what  s needed in hollywood is some sort of    k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care . with its  rights to pollute and drive  theme  by the end  i  m half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his  cold dead hands  speech . lee  i could have forgiven you for this in      but       
well  i  ll be honest it is not exactly a sholay . but you cant get a sholay every week . in fact  you could see distinct signatures of  not without my daughter   sally field       in this movie . however  as most  inspired  movies go  this one was a well  inspired one  well handled and well done . nana patekar  as usual  tends to overdo his hysterics  but all others are commendable . specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time  but she hasn  t lost any of her grace . in fact  she has performed much better that when i last saw her . another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age   br    br   all in all  a nice watch .  
stupid  mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes  piloted by burgess meredith  chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades  old gasoline sludge  driven by lee majors  with chris makepeace as the runaway techno  wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously  and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society . as moronic as it sounds . terrible waste of burgess meredith  but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film .  
the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother  s love  the exceptional performances  the steady execution and the quite innovative script . the film tells the story of an indian woman  nandini  who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja . all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india  of whom she had not even known  is in troubles and the couple rush to india . when they get into the village  nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar  s family  ruled by his cruel  highly cynical and merciless father narasimha  lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless . nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home  but he is soon killed by his father  s enemies . when she wants to leave  narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india . here starts the intense struggle which can be called  nandini vs . narasimha  .  br    br   india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film  but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas  so it may be even correct . the portrayal is in my view fair and not one  sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent . such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world . the locations are amazing  the music is wonderful  and krishna vamshi  s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing . one thing that must be noted is the very ear  pleasing background score by ismail darbar  it is beautiful . the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film . portrayed realistically throughout  the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch . its dialogues are superb and intelligently written  and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points  a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension .  br    br   the film  s biggest strength is the performances . karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini . her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible . she displays so much intensity  impulsiveness  anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son . her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child . after fiza  this is her most powerful performance . one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen  nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha . he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him . patekar displays cruelty  wittiness and even humanity with total conviction . he is outstanding . another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india  s most underrated actress  deepti naval  who sensitises her character to perfection . sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief . anyway  do watch shakti  it could have been better  but it is definitely a must  watch .  
this juvenile  bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens  bodies  desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years . how  by burning up gas and equating a fast  reckless car  or plane  with freedom .  br    br   the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers  neighborhood  if it were run my an oil conglomerate  and logan  s run  if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style  .  br    br   starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post  gas  crisis world in which an all  powerful government doesn  t want you to  ahem  drive your car and burn gas . sort of the opposite of today  s enron  and  bush  oil  grabbing  suv  pushing government .  br    br   this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable . but wait . . . there  s more . although the film is set in the future  we  re not shown any signs of future technology  beyond a return to bicycles  golf carts and horses . you will believe that the future looks . . . exactly like today . same clothing  same suburban houses  same green lawns as today and when the film was made . there are no solar panels  no windmills  no concessions to alternate energy .  br    br   the acting is flat and flavorless . even scenes which could have been gritty or moving  buddy  flick  honor  romance  horror . . . all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase .  br    br   continuity is lacking   the jet flown by burgess meredith  s character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again .  br    br   the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode .  br    br   even die  hard car  film and sf fans should avoid this film like month  old roadkill  unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero  s gas tank .  
if any movie stands out extremely with the actors  acting skills  this is probably the one . i  ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way  but having a strong feeling . the movie was disturbing at moments . however  the movie was terrible at editing . the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs  yet they feel out of place . like karisma is getting beat up  and the same time srk is fighting  comically  with the police officers . the ishq kamina song was very out of place . on top of that  the movie is overly glossy in the beginning . the direction was not bad  but certainly nothing one can brag about .  br    br   i have to say that the actors  were chosen very wisely . without them  this movie would not have an impact . karisma kapoor has given her best role to date  and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza . she looks pretty in the first half  and i  ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her . what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date . nana patekar was excellent as her father  in  law . not much to say about him  besides this is a role made for him . deepti naval as the mother  in  law was excellent especially in her final scene . though she doesn  t have much to say  her facial expressions and body language was good . the other good performance was the little kid . he was adorable  and is sure to bring tears to the viewer  s eyes . the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances . sanjay kapoor was all right  but he didn  t have much to do . shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role .  br    br   one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina . the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song . and boy aish is mad hot . however  the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever . people may have come to the movie for aish  but they won  t brag too much about it after  wards . hum tum miley was properly paced  but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie . damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about . dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie . despite the poor editing  the performances alone make it a must see .  
i saw this movie years ago  and i was impressed . . . but then again i was only   years old . i recently re  watched it and want that time back . this film is pretty bad . while i like lee majors  chris makepeace  watch my bodyguard       if you would like to see a good movie that he was in . . . of meatballs  also starring bill murray  for some laughs   and burgess meredith  this role does  did nothing for their careers .  br    br   anyway  lee majors character  franklyn hart  is an ex  race car driver who plans on driving his race car  which he had in storage  across the country to california . one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation . i thought the concept was ok  not the worse i  ve heard of   but the execution failed horribly .  
the movie was sub  par  but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci  fi fans ideal program . the actors deliver and the special effects  for a television series  are spectacular . having an intelligent interesting script doesn  t hurt either .  br    br   stargate sg  is currently one of my favorite programs .  
there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud . the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring . just a notch above lowbrow  thanks to freeman and spacey  who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films   the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non  existent as justin timberlake  s acting . i hate to knock the guy  but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte  the better .  br    br   the movie isn  t all bad . . . just mostly . i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man . he deserves it . and  unlike his fellow musician and co  star  he can act . kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well  you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery   and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars  out of ten . . . he  s not that good  .  br    br   when all is said and done  the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo  action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake . it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters . all in all  t  s just plain boring . that being said  rent this when you are suffering from insomnia .  
uneven bollywood drama . karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend  sanjay kapoor   has a child  and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords . drama and tragedy ensue  and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller . film is compelling  its few song  dance numbers are uninteresting and needless  the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film  s drama  at least once we  ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative  if ultimately misplaced as well . likewise  the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy  go  lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce  and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with . his throw  away comic  book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film  s primary gripping drama . the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord  and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long  suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film  s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay  s sisters in india  and very pleasing eye candy . but sanjay himself overacts terribly  especially during obvious ad  libs . the directorial style of writer  director krishna wamsi is sloppy  rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts  although his camera movement is good . the musical underscore is also quite effective  moody  featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble  too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti  s soundtrack cd  but bollywood hasn  t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums  at least not in most cases  . but shakti is karisma kapoor  s film  all the way  though  and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes . despite the unevenness of much of the picture  karisma  s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures . in a strange way  also  i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i  d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette  both of which i  d seen just prior  although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism  controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china  s tang dynasty  whose self  serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext .  
after watching this on the mst  k episode  i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from . it seems to combine elements of logans run  farenheight     final sacrifice and at least several others . at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower .  br    br   i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot . like the fact that  even though gas is unavailable  there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations  and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f  race car going all the way across the country .  
what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band . this disc is not for the faint of heart . . . the music is incredibly intense  and very cool . what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long . it is true that their records were great  but their shows were the top of the heap . in     when this concert was shot  the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands  and audiences  had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity   something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina . what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise . try the concert out  it really is amazing .  
dull  flatly  directed  comedy  has zero laughs and wastes a great cast . alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows . newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it  s not enough .  br    br   one of those scripts that  if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer  would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion .  
this is the who at their most powerful . although before the masterwork who  s next  which would provide anthems like baba o  reily and wont get fooled again . this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the    s .  br    br   daltrey shows what being a front  man is all about  entwistle steady as ever .  br    br   moon is great  check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech  and see him playing  side saddle  whilst having a bass drum head replaced   br    br   townsend even looks like he  s enjoying himself occasionally   br    br   considering they took to the stage at  am no one in the crowd was asleep   br    br   there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in   years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one .  
one of the lamer wedding movies you  ll see . smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters . the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke  except they just aint in the least bit funny here . molly ringwald  well what else needs to be said . give you a clue to the silliness  she destroys a        wedding dress  because  it just won  t be me  makes it into this rag  with straps and puts on a top hat  and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy  rather than ringwalding her neck . its a helluva a cast too  check out how heavy ally sheedy is . wheeeew

with this film  bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film  s might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of  objectivity  . obviously  it is not . for one reason  many scenes  shot by pure chance  are obvious set  ups  when that poor goat  accidently  falls off the cliff  you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen   . for another  his concealing of one important information the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film . that is  goitre  a sickness caused by lack of iodine  salt  . this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research  heck  if he checked  cretinism  in a medical dictionary he  d have found  goitre   he might have ended up telling the truth about these people  still  doubtfully  . instead  with his film  he judges them constantly  talking about them as  cretins   again and again  dramatizing the action  setting  up scenes to create the spectacle  all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all  mighty objectivity . bunuel talks all the time in this film  not letting one word to the people he is filming . he talks for them and  even then  judges them . this piece is flawed to it  s roots  to it  s ideology and it  s a real shame it  s considered a great film .  
this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as  mitchell in malta .  at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit . . . not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger . mitchell being mitchell  the film wouldn  t have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either . oh well . at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst . i can  t imagine watching it on it  s own  however .  
this   minute documentary buuel made in the early      s about one of spain  s poorest regions is  in my opinion  one of his weakest films . first  let  s admit that   years later  spain is much richer than it was then  and when i say this  i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own  like excessive individualism and consumerism  though all in all wealth it  s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here  . and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buuel favored  but with western european style capitalism . but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene  the narrator chides that in school  children are taught the value of pi . teaching math to poor people  the horror  . buuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here  not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation . what is he proposing  that children are taught exactly what at school  doesn  t buuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people   
joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material  and almost always under appreciated . he  s been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero  and has the type of strong  solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him . baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor  and that  s what  s so great about him . he really seems to mean what he  s saying  regardless of how clich  obvious or silly  which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones  oliver reed and don stroud . it  s what made the walking tall trilogy work so well  and that same magic is here in final justice . this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the   s  and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era . by moving the action from texas to europe  there  s a real timeless quality that doesn  t jar you away from the action on screen . to be honest  i  ve always enjoyed the films of greydon clark  who is a no  nonsense director in the same vein as     s clint eastwood  and this is one of his best . final justice is one of the lost gems of the late   s  similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence . i suppose if they remake this with the rock  a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do .  
the writer  director of this film obviously doesn  t know anything about film . i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey  because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun .  br    br   the story was awful  the characters were very one dimensional . for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans  that someone is kidding their self  it was probably the writer  director  . no poker fan in this world likes this movie . even your money man hates this project . to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn  t give you the experience to write about poker . keep your day job . and if it  s playing poker  then you must be hurt  n .  
kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie  panaghoy sa suba is very good   it has the drama  the action  the romance  and scene that will make you laugh .  br    br   while the story is not that original  a love triangle   or make a four  cornered  love  japanese occupation  rebellion  american as lord   its presentation is something cool  especially it uses it original language   bisaya for the filipino  nipongo for the japanese and english for the american .  br    br   this movie will go as one of this year  s best pinoy movies .  br    br   go watch this   
as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie  especially as it had scotty nyugen in it .  br    br   basically  scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it .  br    br   the characters are unlikeable and annoying  the soundtrack is awful and the plot  well  there isn  t one .  br    br   i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored . its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn  t have wasted    buying it off ebay .  br    br   take it from me  avoid like   offsuit    dire .    
well it  s been a long year and i  m down to reviewing the final film for     . panaghoy sa suba  call of the river  placed second in the recent metro manila film festival . as expected  it didn  t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies .  br    br   it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen . i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director . his great vision and creativity really helped this film . he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film . also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio . she did a great job portraying bikay  the younger sister of duroy . i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres . i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her .  br    br   some of the camera shots in the film were done very well . the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different .  br    br   in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film . i certainly won  t be raving about the story of this film .  
totally ridiculous . if you know anything about poker  you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless . the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker  but i doubt he  s ever played above    .  i think he also knows nothing of golf .  where to start . i  ve seen better productions in the intro to film class i took freshmen year of film school . the actors to watch in this movie are queen momma  scotty nguyen  and the loser who can never win at poker . everyone else is as wooden as they come  like bad porn actors .  br    br   spoiler the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made . he is a railbird who doesn  t play poker and never has a line of dialogue  but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie . i can  t think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production . it  s fitting that he had such a useless role .  br    br   there  s very little poker in this movie . most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren  t resolved in the slightest . queen momma does have a show  stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out . also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them . their subtle performances are easily among the film  s highlights . it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads .  br    br   in conclusion  complete nonsense . plan  from outer space has slightly more coherency . if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh . also if you  re christian you might enjoy some of the heavy  handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper . i hate movies made by religious people . especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about . it  s sad that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty as i can  t help but think less of them . they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounders .  
i  m grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once  moribund visayan film understorey .  panaghoy  is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular  that claims more speakers than tagalog  . the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines . downside the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist . the other item that i didn  t appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the  period  costume of the same character  and above all  his bright red kit  car that i suppose was meant to pass for a     s roadster . without those small yet glaring details   panaghoy  would  ve been at least a  out of   on my rating   daghang salamat  manoy cesar  addendum this film sure beats peque gallaga  s  oro  plata  mata   which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war . alos  there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg  s  the color purple  and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of  noli me tangere  .  
when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one . now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd  they had not viewed it on the silver screen   my opinion remains the same . the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak .  
as a kid  i loved this game . i played it a zillion times during spring     with my friend andrew . i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored . then streets of rage  came out . and we quickly forgot that this one even existed .  br    br   you play as ex  cops axel stone  adam or blaze fielding  who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way . there are  levels to work thru in a run  down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x . beating up all the bad guys and the end  of  level boss is much fun . level   the bridge  was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river . you even have the chance to become mr . x  s right hand man at the end of the game  at a price  . this leads to the  bad ending  in which you become the the boss of the syndicate . exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr . x  but never mind .  br    br   streets of rage also has truly fantastic music . the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis . the main theme  level one  level  and final boss are standout tunes .  br    br   as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console . but with streets of rage  also available  it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete .  br    br   pros  br    br   average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic  book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game .  br    br   great tunes .  br    br   easy to get into and hard to put down .  br    br   cons  br    br   vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage  .  br    br   poor enemy ai . baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat . this is especially infuriating with the level  boss .  br    br   lack of combo moves .  br    br   lack of decent weapons .  br    br   bad guy models are repeated far too often .  br    br   graphics b  sound a  gameplay b  lasting appeal b   
people  please don  t bother to watch this movie  this movie is bad  it  s totally waste of time . i don  t see any point here . it  s a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor . i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again .  
on sunday july         the first episode of a new science fiction series called  stargate sg    was broadcast on showtime . a spin  off of and sequel to the     film  stargate  starring kurt russell and james spader  the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film . for ten seasons  it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg   . originally  the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o  neill  two  l  s    michael shanks as dr . daniel jackson  amanda tapping as captain samantha carter  christopher judge as teal  c and don s . davis as major general george s . hammond . for ten long years  we watched the team battle against the goa  uld  the replicators  the ori and many other aggressors . at the same time  they forged alliances with the asgard  the tok  ra  the rebel jaffa  the nox and the tollan . they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up  not until death claimed them . and sometimes not even then .  br    br   as with all long  running series  they were numerous cast changes . michael shanks left the series in january     at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor . daniel jackson  s successor as the team  s resident archaeologist  geek was jonas quinn  an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara  played by corin nemec . however  shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june     and nemec left at the same time . unfortunately  he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards . don s . davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march     as he felt that it was time for him to go . the show  s original star and arguably its most popular actor  richard dean anderson  starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons . his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons . he finally left  sg    in march     in order to spend more time with his then six  year  old daughter . jack o  neill was by far my favourite character in the series and  truth be told  i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason .  br    br   the ninth season represented a new era for the programme . with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa  uld and the replicators in season eight  many fans felt the series should go out on a high . regardless  the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa  uld as the series  main adversaries . three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re  invention . ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt . colonel cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg   . his  farscape  co  star  the lovely claudia black  began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious  sexy  hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran  a former goa  uld host and con artist from another planet . a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons  she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season . rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry  the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o  neill and general hammond . for the last two years  they starred alongside the  sg    faithful  michael shanks  amanda tapping and christopher judge  and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise .  br    br   alas  all good things must come to an end . during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten  ratings dropped considerably  resulting in cancellation in its august     . after ten seasons and    episodes  the dream was finally over . on march         what began with  children of the gods  ended with  unending  . the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci  fi channel in the united states on june        .  br    br   in the ten years that the series was on the air  it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series   star trek   in terms of popularity in certain countries . it became the second  longest running sci  fi series in the world  second only to  doctor who              and the longest  running american produced sci  fi series  having surpassed  the x  files  only a few months before it ended .  br    br    stargate sg    represents the cornerstone of the  stargate  franchise . in      its success and popularity led to the production of a spin  off series entitled  stargate atlantis   which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and    episodes in august     . although plans for another feature film fell through  two direct  to  dvd films   stargate the ark of truth  and  stargate continuum   were released in     and more are planned for the not too distant future . a third live  action series   stargate universe   is also due to premiere at some point next year .  there was  unfortunately  an animated series   stargate infinity   which ran only from     to     but the less said about that the better  . despite the end of  sg    and  atlantis  as continuing series  the future of  stargate  looks very bright indeed .  br    br   in conclusion  while  stargate  has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci  fi television franchises such as  star trek  and  doctor who   its still relatively new compared to those two sci  fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many  many years to come .  
honestly before i watched this movie  i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace . i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie  and watched it by my own . apparently they were right . i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie  why the hell did i watch this movie .  br    br   of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie  theater business . but morgan and kevin  i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison . to be honest  their roles are rather stupid .  br    br   well you might think if the players suck  then i should pay more attention to the story . it is indeed story is the core of a movie  but guys . . . trust me . . . this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story . imagine this  a smart  ass journalist  justin timberlake  wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a  real  journalist from his boss  morgan freeman  . this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice  ll cool j  and an brilliant investigator  kevin spacey  . at the end  they beat the system with a happy ending story .  br    br   jeez  i could not even carry on with this . just recalling the movie is making me sick already . my advise guys  don  t watch this  please save your money and time for another movie .  
imdb lists this as     for some reason  but the other sources i  ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as    . doesn  t really matter  except that it  s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video  one of the first art works to merge the two apparently  in the context of the star gate sequence in      released the same year . pure abstraction isn  t really my thing  but i can take it in small doses and the super  saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers  rohrschach blots  birds  etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful . certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the   s  and deserves to be better known .  
amateur  no budget films can be surprisingly good . . . this however is not one of them .  br    br   ah  another brad sykes atrocity . the acting is hideous  except for emmy smith who shows some promise . the camera  direction  needs serious reworking . and no more  hold the camera and run  gimmicks either it just doesn  t work . the special effects are unimaginative  there  s a problem when the effect can be identified in real time . if you  re going to rip off an ear  please don  t let us see the actor  s real ear beneath the blood . the scenery is bland and boring  same as mr . sykes other ventures   and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal  see the scenery comment  .  br    br   did i mention the lack of any real plot  or character development  apparently  the scriptwriter didn  t .  br    br   whoever is funding this guy . . . please stop . i  ve seen some of his other  home movies   which i will not plug  and they are just as bad . normally  a  director  will grow and learn from his previous efforts . . . not this guy . it  s one thing to be an amateur filmmaker  but anyone can be a hack .  br    br   definitely not even a popcorn film . . . of course  chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort .  br    br   award the worst ever military push  ups in a film .  
all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done . it may not be up to par with what everyone expects  but look at it this way . would you expect perfection in hell  it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose . it was great to see her character transformation in this movie  considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get . i hope for a sequel very soon . if we want live action  i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori . i don  t think lady death would transfer well to film . but be that as it may  it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong . no pun intended .  
an updated version of a theme which has been done before . while that in and of itself is not bad  this movie doesn  t reach the ring like the other  inherent and pure  evil ones do .  br    br   predictable  ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark . not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending .  
it  s a very good movie  not only for the fans of lady death comics  but also for those who like animated movies  series of adventure and fantasy .  br    br   the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn  t done  but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell  lucifer himself .  br    br   then she seeks revenge . . . and the rest you better see it from the movie .  br    br   i liked the movie a lot  the characters are like the original comics  form chaos . i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics  only the last ones  after the passages in the movie  so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics  but . . . one way or another it  s the story of lady death   
this is a typical  perfect crime  thriller . a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer  ignoring all the clues  immediately knows who guilty is . the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught . the result is like every single episode of  columbo  or  murder she wrote  . the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock  this story barely fills up   minutes but the director insists on using all    minutes filling with every cliche in the book . skip this one  you are not missing anything .  
i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating  s some people have given it . it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated  now if you don  t like comic books or animation then of course you won  t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me . though  if you are a fan of interesting  strong characters and heroic  sexy  women kicking butt and saving the world  hell  you will love this movie . i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie . quite anime  esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation . like titan a . e . meet  s the live action version of punisher . in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie .  
murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made  for  tv but isn  t . considering the only actor of any note is bullock  although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things   it isn  t a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things . like . . . remembering to lock your front door when you go out . or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower .  br    br   bullock plays cassie mayweather  a cop with personal issues  don  t they all  . together with her new partner  a wet  looking ben chaplin   she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman . nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they  ve planned and executed the perfect murder . as the investigation continues  a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood  ryan gosling  .  br    br   the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless . bullock  though she is very nice to look at  is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield  actually  he  d be better   . chaplin  for his sins  is a complete non  entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood . at least gosling and pitt  as the conniving sneering suspects  acquit themselves adequately . as if dodgy leads weren  t bad enough  a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable  but illogical  ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run .  br    br    murder by numbers  has absolutely nothing going for it  even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn  t redeem it . well  just a little but still not enough to save it . forgettable  predictable and redundant  this is one film that isn  t going to move the cop genre forward . as cassie probably says on her next case  there  s nothing to see here people . move along  keep moving . . .  
i love the movies and own the comics  the comics are different then the movie but still i  d give it   out of   . it was awesome . if the movies got anymore awesome . i would have her babies . and i am female . read the comics you won  t regret it . yes in this movie since brian p . the artist for her died we don  t get nearly as good artistic work . i mean seriously don  t get me wrong these people did great  but different versions for different people . different strokes for different folks as the saying goes . any guy who doesn  t go bonkers over her is insane  or does not like women  or you know just plan insane . if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure  but hey there is always toes .  
well  the writing was very sloppy  the directing was sloppier  and the editing made it worse  at least i hope it was the editing  . the acting wasn  t bad  but it wasn  t that good either . pretty much none of the characters were likable . at least   minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential . it was a great idea  but yet another wasted good idea goes by . it could have ended  different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending . and what wasn  t predictable was done so badly that it didn  t matter . the ending was not worth watching at all . sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies . the movie looked rushed also . the movie just wasn  t really worth seeing  and had i paid for it i would have been very mad . maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one . the movie over all was not horrifibly bad  but i wouldn  t reccomend it . i gave it  out of   b  c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character  justin i believe  the super smart one  . and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes . it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape  it was not pretty . anyway  if you see it  wait for the   .   theater or video  unless you like pretty much every movie you see  then i guess you  ll like this one .  
although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death .  br    br   i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance .  br    br   the animation was ok  i got the sense of the    s anime from it which is what set it off for me . why everyone else hates that is beyond me .  br    br   character development was fine . i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around . for you who don  t like it  obviously wasn  t paying attention . lucifer tells you how it happens  and she used his words .  br    br   creamtor was a nice mentor  soldier for her . his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie .  br    br   i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider . cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d  
at first the movie seemed to be doing great  they had the characters profiles set . . . the plot seemed to be going in the right direction . . . however  as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things . . . or just a lot was edited from the movie . the characters  identities changed for the worse within the movie . also  there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning   in other words   they had things within the movie that didn  t seem to fit the movie itself . and the title . . . no where in the movie does the title fit the movie . . . i suppose the title works for the previews . . . . actors did well with what they had . . . . . if they had a better director and writer  maybe this would have worked out better . but it didn  t . so now there  s a new terrible movie coming out this friday . . . . my opinion  . . . . don  t waste your time or money .  
rented this one accidentally  it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting  didn  t find out until i got home  watched it anyways . absolutely fantastic  a wonderful movie  and one of my top three favorite of all time  i recommend it to everyone   br    br   the story is enjoyable and easy to follow  this could have been easily messed up  but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together .  br    br   the actors themselves are fantastic  displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job .  br    br   gotta find a copy somewhere . . . . . . . . . . .  
so  i  m wondering while watching this film  did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock  s wardrobe by dragging out her  before  clothes from miss congeniality  did ms . bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the  before  gracie hart  as many reviewers have noted before  the film is very formulaic . add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest .  br    br   the two bad boy serial killers have been done before  and better  in other films . as has the  good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence  character been seen before . in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes .  br    br   one last peeve  using the term serial killer is false advertising . murdering one person  even if it  s a premeditated murder  does not make you a serial killer . you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer .  
in my years of attending film festivals  i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution  and they end up in the   bins at walmart . i just found dvd of yank tanks there  great doc  but how sad for it to end up as a rock  bottom remainder .  br    br   i loved this film  wish i  d seen it at the cinema in it  s everything . i  d have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly . it  s good for americans to stretch a little . if the film  s title helps the us audience to explore random chaos  all the better . cinema imitates life  visa versa .  br    br   also  i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars . come on  the euro is not hard to figure out  make the gringo audiences do the math . seeing a film  especially one shot in paris  the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me .  br    br   looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer  director as well .  
from director barbet schroder  reversal of fortune   i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class  and i recognised the leading actress  so i tried it  despite the rating by the critics . basically cool kid richard haywood  half nelson  s ryan gosling  and justin pendleton  bully  s michael pitt  team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them . investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie  the hyena  mayweather  sandra bullock  with new partner sam kennedy  ben chaplin   who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene  e . g . non  relating hairs . the plan doesn  t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects  it is just a question of if they can sway them away . also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills  chris penn as ray feathers  r . d . call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst . d . a . al swanson . i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock  s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing  but this film does it in a very silly way  and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable . adequate   
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema . the story is enchanting  the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful . i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie .  
alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think ofhe set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him .  br    br   the main subject of this bullock vehicle  all the ideas  almost everything was already in hitchcock  s classic  rope  the two students who commit a gratuitous crime  nietsche  s philosophy  and the clues that the boys disseminate  the master was the first to transfer them to the screen . and with an eighty  minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force .  br    br    murder by numbers  does not take place in a single room  like  the rope   mind you . and  what a supreme originality  it pits two cops against the evil youngstersand  you would never guess it  these two cops are very differentactually  bullock plays the part of woman living like a man  and her partner  chaplin  is as shy as a clueless girlie . the two boys  performances are not really mind  boggling  not as good  as  say  that of edward norton in  primal fear  .  br    br   well  you know   rope  was so good . . . .  
seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers . perhaps it  s because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth  or are we missing something  i  d watch it again if i had some incentive .  br    br   so what  s a happenstance  to the french it is  le battement d  ailes du papillon  serendipity  fate  perhaps it  s an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings . we  ve all had these  it  s called life  but when looked at in this way  you begin to get the feeling that  random  might be more like  fated .   br    br   a  happenstance  in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble . all these incidents cause other events that . . . well you get the picture  dominoes . multiply those by   characters and an average of  each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen . and i think that there  s a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this . but then this is the magic world of cinema .  br    br   we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer  director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens . if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape  here  s the place to do it . or if you  re recovering from surgery and aren  t going anywhere anyway  this will engage you while your stitches are healing .  br    br    happenstance  will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following . stranger things have happened .  br    br   soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following  life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward .  if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences  meeting your first love  finding the perfect gift  your last auto accident  you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it .  br    br   that  s the answer  i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain  happenstance  to me .  
there  s something frustrating about watching a movie like  murder by numers  because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out . however  by the time the credits roll  there  s no saving it . the whole thing is pretty much blown by the  cop side  of the story  where sandra bullock and ben chaplin  s homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on . although bullock is strong in her role  it  s not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing . ben chaplin  s talents are wasted in a forgettable role  he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated  birthday girl   as well as chris penn  who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him . anyway  the plot really isn  t even a factor in this movie at all . the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie . their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well . it  s too bad they weren  t in a much better all  around film . barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker . bottom line it  s worth a rent if you  re a genre fan  but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it  except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks .  
  happenstance  is the most new york  feeling parisian film i  ve seen since  when the cat  s away  chacun cherche son chat  .   br    br   a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for  amelie   its french title is more apt  le battement d  ailes du papillon  the beating of the butterfly  s wings   as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives .  br    br   tatou  s gamine  ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures  and because she  s part of a large  multi  ethnic ensemble  so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters  especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me  and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn  t sure if they were doing that or not .  br    br   but i loved how urban the coincidences were  from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafs .  br    br   the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once .  br    br    originally written            
having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock  s performance in miss congeniality  i decided to give murder by numbers a shot . while decent in plucky  self  effacing roles  ms . bullock  s performance in  serious  roles  see hope floats  speed     days  leave much to be desired . her character is at the same time omniscient  confused  and sexually maladjusted  the sub  plot of sandra  s past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character  . the two teenage boys gave decent performances  although their forensics expertise and catch  me  if  can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream  we did it   chris penn as the all  too  obvious suspect is wasted here  as is ben chaplin  s token partner  love interest character .  br    br   spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside  the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv  of  the  week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place  and as mentioned  the stupid errors  vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene  an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor  the two boys hanging out together in public  a convenient love interest to cause friction  etc . etc  cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers . the ending was strictly  by the numbers  and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie . using the now  cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film  and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment  the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so  called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it  s conclusion . a somewhat promising concept  but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way .  out of  .  
  stargate sg    follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg   through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole .  br    br   having seen this series sporadically for it  s first few seasons when it first came out  i didn  t know how good this series would really be    years after i had last seen an episode . my old impression was that the series was great  but my impression was far from the truth .  stargate sg    is more than just a simple sci  fi series  it is one of the most well made  interesting  long running  exciting sci  fi ever produced . and why  because it runs on an amazing premise .  br    br   this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television  as a medium  with a suitable premise  is able to provide something that doesn  t work on the time restriction of film . the sense of familiarity created by a long running series  watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief  and it  s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show .  br    br    stargate sg    kept offering great adventures throughout the   years  but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show  br    br    the first few seasons  perhaps up to the  th   th  focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations  keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul  d threat .  br    br    from the  th to the  th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul  d and preventing attacks on earth . after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg   in a place of goaul  d  replicator  ori conflicts  br    br    the  th season is probably the most mixed one . it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned  but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments .  br    br    the  th and   th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o  neil . they are both good continuations  although the first few episodes of the   th season are a little weak  because they seem to be about little more than sg   and human  jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori .  br    br   basically  after season   exploration was pushed to the background  which in many ways was a shame  because of the potential and mystery each planet  episode  presented on the other hand  it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were .  br    br   even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest  the feeling i have is that it could go on the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer . a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome  but ultimately things are as they are .  br    br   in the end  because of the fact that i enjoyed everything  it  s a little hard to find that it ends . the big picture  however  the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of   years  is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew  those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg   .  
lets enter the world of this movie for a second  so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here .  br    br   edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose       bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars  shouting at them  and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him . . . . . . instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief . . . . instead of just walking up and pop  . . . . . what do you do  the bad guy . . . . . he talks to him . he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun . they have nothing to talk about  shoot him  shoot him now  but he talks to him anyway . oh another thing . at the end  a newspaper says  pulitzer prize winner story right here  or something right above on a front page of a paper  when its like the first time the story is printed . so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast  yea  you know those types of stupid movies  yea well that  s edison in a nutshell .  br    br   you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely  ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie  while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places  and who  s last line  duck  was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made . . . and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks  little cocky bastard . the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best  denzel from training day  impression  which was pretty entertaining .  br    br   oh yea so whats the movie about  eh  something about scandals involving the city edison  s fictional special unit police force called  f . r . a . t .  i swear i  m not making this stuff up  which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s . w . a . t . anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving  undercover cops from frat  and he goes scurrying off looking for a story  gaining his boss   freeman  trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought . blah blah blah . its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day . the pacing was slow and off  the script was horrible  and the acting was extremely uninspired . it jumped everywhere without going anywhere . people get put in comas and you forget about them . everyone in this movie just didn  t think . damn what a stupid movie . its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended . . . no lie basically  do not waste your time   
this isn  t exactly a great film  but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . the film  s main theme is fate and small  seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors  though instead of focusing on one random event  seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . plus  an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene   like he  s some sort of omnipotent being but there  s absolutely no explanation of him in the film  like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy  .  br    br   the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou . this is capitalize on her success in amelie  though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . the pace is brisk  the acting fine and the conclusion isn  t bad at all . the only reason i didn  t score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .  
hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse        and now only seems to do  by the numbers  hollywood thrillers .  br    br   this is very lightweight john grisham material  crossed with the plot of a tv movie . bullock is cass mayweather  a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers . ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy  and together they make an uncomfortable duo . not good  when two unbalanced college maladriots  gosling and pitt  decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene .  br    br   fair enough  but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks  we also have to endure a several dull overly  melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass  s history . then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff  side log cabin where there  s absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set . oooh . . . the atmosphere .  br    br   watch any episode of csi instead . it  s to the point and far more exciting .  
narratives  whether written  visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers  after all  can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who . this is especially true in film  i think  simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema . viewers like myself  however  don  t have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs .  br    br   a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou  a french actress  whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain       and later in a very long engagement        both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters . this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity .  br    br   now  other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player        short cuts        gosford park       and others paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia       . stanley kramer did it with a mad  mad  mad  mad world in      a comedy of almost epic proportions . the difference with this film is  first the director lets us  see  inside the head of some of the characters and second  some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer  s memory as the story flip  flops between different time periods .  br    br   the basic  the core  so to speak  story concerns a young woman  irene  tautou  who is told  by a fellow commuter on a train  that she will meet her true love on that day . this occurs in the first few minutes of the film . the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn  t realize that the young man opposite  gilbert robin  may be that  one true love  . and  nor does he . . .  br    br   they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter . however  chaos results throughout the rest of the day  not only for the two young people  but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere  and yet . . .  br    br   if the story were simply that  it could tend to be boring  and even quite predictable . not so . the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace  but which are turned into believable  extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again . for example  the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours  consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again . or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen  consider again what would happen . . .  br    br   all of that is interesting enough . what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene  or whether it was  in fact  the young man on the train . that kept me guessing for a while .  br    br   i  ll let you think about that  should you see this delightful romp .  br    br   recommended for all .  
except for acknowledging some nice cinematography  i can hardly say anything positive about this movie . the single real issue is the protagonist  s dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life . abundant  emotionally powerful  scenes do not go with this plot and  because of bad acting  they also fail to create the intended atmosphere . the director only manages to introduce anthony  s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution . the characters do not seem to evolve  although it is difficult to speak of any characters . . . perhaps except for sonny . beside him  actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to  they come off as self  indulging amateurs . i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script  throwing away all the potential of the plot  or the bad acting  disturbing any appeal that might be left .  
this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment  its the best ending of any movie i  ve ever seen . perfect  beautiful  funny  simply wonderful .  br    br   i found this movie delightful  even with it  s french taking  itself  too  seriously deep meanings thing going on . i loved it  it  s a great love story . and i loved the way algerians were woven in  and by the way  the music during the final credits is great . i want the cd   
they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station . they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived . you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot  four young boys playing in grainy slow motion  accompanied by voice over narration . next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion . once they  re grown  it  s easy to spot the writer  director among the four . he  s the quiet  contemplative  long  haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants . this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood . only there  s no writing  or directing talent on display here . and if you still can  t figure out which one he is  here  s a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name . it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty  something men were supposed to still be in high school . what looked like a prison was apparently a high school  the warden turned out to be the principal . once more  the poor  misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement  murder and pillage  but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father . how about hitting back  kid  like you do everyone else  numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose . howlingly bad dialogue . many scenes badly out of focus . cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras  drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience . overacting in the extreme . and if you don  t quite get the self  important speeches  or the slow  motion scenes  just listen to the overbearing music . it will clue you in and what you  re supposed to feel . poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films . the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies  run over puppies chained to a tree  rob and steal  all the while complaining about their sad  sorry lives . but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college . yeah  that  s the ticket . why is it that every twenty  something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important  so interesting  that the world can  t wait to see it onscreen  if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems  then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants .  
this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular  amelie   both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role . laurent firode  the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory .  br    br   the film deals with chance  as its english title indicates . the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly  as well as hurricanes in the pacific  something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects . from the start  the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other  something that is hard to imagine  but in the film  s context seems to work well .  br    br   a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film . irene  who is going to work  is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper . irene  it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day . after irene leaves the train  the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene . it seems they are destined to one another from the start  but alas  they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film .  br    br   audrey tautou is wonderful as irene . faudel  who plays younes  doesn  t have a lot to do until the end  but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part . the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film  which is as light as butterfly wings .  br    br   we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected .  
a lot of people seemed to have liked the film  so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review . but after sitting through   minutes of it  i feel i have to do so . where the heck is the plot in this film   i must have missed it  i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened . sure the ending was  somewhat shocking  but they didn  t build up to it . i forgot who was who half of the time  so they didn  t really develop the characters . the acting was so  so  most of the time it was believable  but i was able to see through it most of the time . so . . . without giving anything away  i must say that unless you like the actors in the film  there is no real reason to watch this movie . i could be mistaken  but i just didn  t understand why there was so little  or too much of the film . i can  t decide which one that would be  so i say judge for yourselves . i don  t even know if renting it would be a good idea  the cost and all . . .  br    br   plot     characters     acting     overall     i feel like that  s too high really  i am staying with my vote up at the top .  
to me  this review may contain spoilers  but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen  so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers   br    br   i just watched this movie again  and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie . ever . ever . ever . the real translation   the beating of the butterfly  s wings   is oddly not used as the translated title . i suppose they thought most americans wouldn  t know what chaos theory is  except for those who saw or read  jurassic park   . the movie is based on chaos theory  and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events  which all lead back to one event . the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect  as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters  about     . in a way  the ending seems inevitable despite this  but if you think about it  it is a perfect ending . think to yourself   what else needed to be said   it is at the same time a very brave ending . too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one  but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .  br    br    
dick foran and peggy moran  who were so good together in the mummy  s hand  return for this very minor universal horror offering . but this time  instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick  babe   we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named  stuff  . but the results are nowhere near as charming  and the scare level is virtually nil .  br    br   dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as  the phantom  who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself .  br    br   this  phantom  is not very mysterious  and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . it  s always nice to see perky moran  but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal  s instantly forgettable misfires .  
most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character  it is not really audrey tautou  s real life personality  hence  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part   part   etc .  br    br   now with that said  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it . yes  it  s true  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn  t seen at all for maybe   min  but i didn  t even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters . the guy who lies about everything is too funny  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss  actually . . . . getting into all the characters here could take quite a while  but this is one of the best movies i  ve seen in a while .  br    br   audrey tautou  s character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was . in fact  as irene  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first . in this film  irene is a girl with good intentions  but over the course of a  very awful  day  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .  br    br   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building . . . very entertaining to watch  great scenery and shots  very colorful and never too slow  and all of the characters can actually act . the best part of the movie comes with about   minutes left . . . . this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms . i swear  it was the best   minutes of film i  ve seen in quite a while  and the ending . . . . it made me think  damn i really lucked out finding this movie  . the ending to this movie is top notch . whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant  because not only are there all these other subplots going on  but to somehow make them all tie in together  and in a sensible manner  which is the case here  but also to make each character feel human and come alive  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect . . . very impressive .  br    br   i highly suggest this movie as it  s a great film to watch anytime  in any mood  with any company or alone .  
a horribly pointless and  worse  boring film . stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything  no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes  and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way .  br    br   will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey  s truman show  and substitutes his usual shouting routine  admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights  for  well  pretty much nothing .  br    br   emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating  that some reviews i  ve read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable  whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy . please . that she ended up falling for ferrell  s  character  is utterly ludicrous .  br    br   marc forster  s attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with .  br    br   i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this . i wish i  d opted for the prestige .  
the mystery here is why this delightful  small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves . simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti .  br    br   lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations  its rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and  unlike some of its more critically acclaimed competition in the genre  such as the taste of others  it actually entertains .  
stranger than fiction angered me so much  i signed up on imdb just to write this review . stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex  touching and thought  provoking movie until the very end . once you suspend multiple lapses of logic  why didn  t will ferrell hear emma thompson  s voice   years ago when she fist started writing her book   the phone rang . the phone rang again .  how could she not know it  s him calling  etc .   the movie challenges one  s thoughts about mortality  fate  and sacrifice .  br    br   the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors . and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure  even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith .  br    br   ah  but the ending . until the very end  i would have given  out of   stars to this movie . the movie as a metaphor for life  s journey  as a tribute to the notion of  writing true   as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy  but not both  is outstanding . the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell  s fate . and no matter how endearing a character he may have become  we know full well why we will accept the ending . the last act occurs  the screen goes white  the credits roll . a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . an end that would have been debated for weeks .  br    br   no           no credits rolled . say it isn  t so . say hollywood didn  t tack on another   minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . dustin hoffman got it right when he said   it  s no longer a masterpiece it  s ok .  an apt review of the movie . except to me  it wasn  t even ok . i was so offended about the betrayal of  writing true   about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . i don  t often cry . i could care less about most movies  but i am still angry about this one .  br    br   my questions for zack helm  the writer  are this did the original movie end when the screen went white  and were you forced by the vapid movie powers  that  be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie  or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself  i  ve read you  re brilliant . i hope your original script ended the movie the first time .  br    br   i know zack helm will never see this review  and i  ve been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . but  please  movie  goers  am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction  one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now .  
the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific . according to this theory  somehow related to the chaos theory  i  m not sure exactly how   every action  no matter how small or insignificant  will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events . this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly  unrelated characters  most of them in paris  whose actions will affect each others  lives .  the six  degrees  of  separation theory can be applied as well .  each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film . the acting is finely  tuned and nuanced  audrey tautou is luminous   the stories mesh plausibly  the humor is just right  and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement .  
a badly  acted two  character comedy  drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren  t  we  awful  to  the  indians polemic  with lousy special effects  exploitative use of nudity  and ugly violence . it  s as sincere as a politician  s handshake  as obvious as a car salesman  s pitch  one of the worst movies in the history of the universe . absolute and utter dreck .  
we have to remember that the    s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies . hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies  noir  two reel oaters  etc to movies with a message . we had blackboard jungle  on the waterfront and so on . some folks might think that was an improvement . i don  t . who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message  call western union  he was right . these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy .  br    br   this one is a pip . it  s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father  s estate . one of them  maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay . he  s initially in it for the bucks  but eventually falls for her . meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance . the results are predictable . you get a little bit of everything in this movie . sexual tension between the sisters . a little subtle masochism . hereditary insanity  if there is such a thing . we never get to meet the parents  but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown . one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar . the acting is so bad it  s hard to believe . it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel  air productions . it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits . the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke . it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene .  br    br   i can  t explain it  not even to myself  but i gave this pile of trash an     . i  m familiar with the term  it  s so bad it  s good   but i don  t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before . well  maybe  hot rods to hell   but this one certainly fits . you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody  s basement .  
spoilers contained  br    br   i  d heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . what i didn  t expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . what starts off as a typical cowboy  indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic  comedy  about honus  soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss  and cresta  candice bergen  who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne . the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . they then escape and both turn up  separately  at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base . as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . so far so ordinary . then comes the ending . after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they  won  t they get together storyline  the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn  t resort to extreme gratuitous violence . in some ways  soldier blue reminds me of frank perry  s last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . i didn  t hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents  i would recommend elem klimov  s come and see .

soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man  s inhumanity to man  on the white man  s exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting  unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam . well  sorry  but it fails miserably to be any of those things . what soldier blue actually is is pernicious  trite  badly made  dishonest rubbish .  br    br   another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies . what it is basically is a lame  clichd  poorly acted  odd couple  romance  strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other  s lifestyle and falling in love  ah  bless   bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn  t have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick .  br    br   there is no excuse for the repulsive  prurient  gore  drenched climax  in which cute little native american children are variously shot  sliced  dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close  up  and large  breasted native american women are molested  raped and strung up  no excuse  that is  except box office .  the massacre itself  whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention  is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them  intercut with a few special  effects sequences of beheading  dismemberment  dismemberments  incidentally  which utilised real amputees in their filming . now that  s what i call exploitation .   br    br   forget all the pap you  ve heard  including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie  about this being a  protest   an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples . this film doesn  t give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters  would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless  faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax . instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss  lousy actors both  in this at least   with plenty of blood  guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious .  br    br   which is a terrible shame  because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre  about all of the real life massacres the us  and britain  and all so  called  civilised  nations  have participated in over the centuries  iraq   . this just isn  t that movie .  
the first and second seasons started off shakily  with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones  and at times resorting to clichd stories . but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it  s characters more  it became a lot more fun and entertaining .  br    br   the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson  peter deluise  joseph malozzie and paul mullie . richard  s dry sense of humour makes to show so much better  peter  s directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining  and joe  paul never fail to make a funny  interesting episode together .  br    br   once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters  i doubt you won  t like the show . for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes  the other side   a good serious episode  and  window of opportunity   a classic comic relief episode .  
the movie started off strong  ll cool j  deed  as an undercover police officer  with partner sgt . lazerov  dylan mcdermott from the practice  possibly miscast as a bad guy   committing robbery and murder . deed refuses to kill the drug dealer  which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience . the other big names  freeman  spacey et al  are well cast and the movie shows promise .  br    br   the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake  pollack  is introduced . given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly  or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake  i would choose the former . even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him . i would have thought he would put on a better show  given the fact that he has been acting talented for years . everything he did in this film was unconvincing .  br    br   just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums  it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films . even hardcore n  sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent .  br    br   that aside there are a few plot holes  such as pollack  s sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery . this movie had so much promise . thoroughly disappointing .  
that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say .  it  s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally  too .  only two of the sisters are really bad . boy  are they bad  too  one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e  er she goes . the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe . she has those sensual  slightly parted lips . and  not to give anything away  she is even more bad than the other .  br    br   all three sisters are played by starlets . the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield . he had something of a career .  br    br   this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft  core porn ever marketed . well  of course not the first but the raciest at that time .  br    br   the girls wear as little as possible and let  s not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor   whose fetish was this    bare  chested . he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit .  br    br   there  s a real plot here  too the girls  family  see  is cursed . they are prone to suicide   or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide .  br    br   the movie is not bad . i truly don  t know where it was shown . maybe it was made for drive  ins . somehow  and i could be wrong  i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here . the women are scantily dressed . they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels .  br    br   but the guy seems to be the central focus . not everyone in the movie likes him  but all the girls love him . and i think the audience is meant to also .  br    br   it  s lots of fun   and on its own terms  too .  
first of all  this film can be divided into three segments . a promising opening  with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne . this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section  with the totally miscast candice bergen and  soldier blue  traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison . miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth  and looks like she just walked out of a     s jack nicholson movie . i mean she maintains zero interest  with zero believability . the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village . this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti  war propaganda  that it comes across as simply long  outrageous  and contrived . not recommended .  merk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jacobe  comment above  here  s an idea . why don  t you actually watch the movie you are commenting on  instead of chirping your liberal nonsense . this is not a political site  it is for reviewing films .  merk

when sam peckinpah  s superlative the wild bunch       opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra  violence  it did so with a talented  if whisky  marinated  hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth  but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah  s epic  and soldier blue definitely falls into that category .  br    br   soldier blew  er  blue tells the story of foul  mouthed new yorker cresta lee  candice bergen  a blonde proto  hippie chick who  s been  rescued  from two years of  captivity  among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she  ll be reunited with the fiance she only wants to marry for his money . also on board the wagon she  s traveling in is a shipment of government gold  cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with  so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills  accompanied by honus gant  peter strauss   the lone surviving cavalryman . calling gant by the snarky nickname  soldier blue   cresta demonstrates that her years among the  savages  was time well spent  outstripping gant in survival skills  common sense  and sheer balls  and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements  a band of hostile kiowa  an unscrupulous trader  played by donald pleasance  here giving one of his most ridiculous performances  and that  s saying something  and  in the tradition of many previous western  set romantic comedies  each other .  br    br   during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while gant has a freshly  treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg  no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn  t filled with rattlesnakes  mountain lions  or who knows what  to say nothing of the cheyenne  who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment  there i go  thinking in nyc real estate terms again  .  br    br   realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave  cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won  t spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village  and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby  to  be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what  s coming .  br    br   what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead  in to a hideous reenactment of the     sand creek massacre  an orgy of rape  torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of  keeping the country clean   and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty . children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets  unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect  i have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes  then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight  so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts  which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered  their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs . no joke  this scene would instantly garner an nc    rating if released today  to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted .  br    br   i  m all in favor of westerns that don  t shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won  or stolen if truth be told  but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it  s a heavy  handed pseudo  hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up  well  duh    then it  s a light  hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho  with no undies   but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally    hilarious pair of buck  toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub  plot that goes nowhere  all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax . any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film  but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film  s promotion and poster imagery .  br    br   but by trying to be all things to all audiences  soldier blue ends up as an incoherent  preachy mulligan stew of presumably well  intentioned political correctness  but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre  wouldn  t it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk  ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece  we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing  the most savage film in history .  if you  like me  were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its  daring to tell it like it was   take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity .  
the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine . it  s one interesting twist on the themes from it  s a wonderful life .  br    br   zero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york . mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade  but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working . kaminsky is mostly bedridden . he  s reduced to applying for welfare . in desperation like jimmy stewart  he cries out to god for some help .  br    br   now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently  but even stewart had trouble accepting travers . but travers had one thing going for him  he was over    years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone . god sent mostel something quite different  the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment .  br    br   belafonte hasn  t accepted he  s moved on from life  he  s still got a lot of issues . he also has a wife  gloria foster  who doesn  t know he  s passed on  hit by a car right at the beginning of the film . you put his issues and mostel  s issues and you  ve got a good conflict  starting with the fact that mostel can  t believe in a black jew named levine .  br    br   this was the farewell performance for polish  jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back . the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo o  shea playing a nice jewish doctor . remembering o  shea  s brogue from the verdict  i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor .  br    br   the angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society . it  s brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud . make sure to catch it when broadcast .  
other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes  this film is a true stinker .  br    br   this is the second film that i  ve seen in recent days directed by alexander korda . the first was charles laughton  s  rembrandt .  it was so lousy that i shut it off . this one i  m afraid is not very much better .  br    br   flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth . perhaps  her performance as the virgin queen was good for     standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren  it is absolutely no match . in robotic fashion  robson states her lines . her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit .  br    br   even a dashing laurence olivier can  t save this utter piece of boredom .  br    br   future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn  t really convey anything here . to think  that scarlett was  years later   br    br   it  s a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film .  
some spoilers  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms  acting  dated dialogue  unclear storyline  unfounded . belafonte is great as a brandoesque  menacing  swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill  equipped from his past life to do so . he learns too late how empty his hustling  materialistic life was without love . mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny . in spite of his prayers for a miracle  his bitterness prevents him from accepting  or believing  in one . the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other  the result being hilarious and touchingly sad .  br    br   the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film . after looking everywhere for belafonte  mostel looks up to see a falling feather  and he frantically reaches for it as if he  s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles . but belafonte wasn  t allowed to finish his miracle  either to restore fanny  s health or mostel  s faith   so he never got his wings . the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel  s grasp  a metaphor for both men  s live it  s too late and you don  t get a second chance . like  it  s a wonderful life   this movie is magical  wonderful  funny  but terribly tragic .  
i remembered the title so well . to me  it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles . and it had vincent massey  s voice from behind whiskers . well flora robson was great . her next signature  for me  would be    days at peking  . the same role but with different sumptuous gowns . and the same voice . as for the armada  it was a subtext . i like black  and  white films . was everything done in elizbethan times at night  it was talky and difficult to fathom  at times . i couldn  t tell which was the love interest . was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh  and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada . apparently it worked for the empire  but not for the script . this might have been more accurate  historically  but bette davis had more engaging scripts . and i missed daylight   
 . . . and i do mean it . if not literally  after all  i have not seen every movie ever created    at least  obviously  among the ones  the many i know .  br    br    .     the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly  for example  the piece of kannes  kompetition  krowned  korean  kraap called  oldboy   can be truly bad . but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under  . this movie  very much worth watching  is . a disgrace .  br    br   true  i give it a   in protest . the movie is not perfect . its true rating should be an  or a  . it has some acting flaws  belafonte especially   the script wanders around  sometimes . however  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times  the czech jan kadar  directing two of the greatest actors of all time  the beloved  larger  than  life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting  poetic  moral tour de force . a pair made in heaven  it  s true that this movie  little flaws apart  does not pander to the average audiences  but those interested in watching an excellent  while  again  not beyond criticism  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  the shop on the main street   the best movie ever about holocaust  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  american beauty  is better than  the angel levine  .  br    br   it isn  t .  
spoilers  br    br   well  the one line summary says it all . melvilles  le samurai  is the original and there are elements of  leon  . and they are better  much better   br    br   in the  samurai  alain delon is a lonely warrior  professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs  with so much suspense in these scenes   . even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it .  br    br   delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog . but i guess jarmusch liked  leon  very much or even  desperado  by rodriguez . so he added this  too . and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog  like natalie portman in  leon     br    br   so what was jarmusch thinking after all  where is the unique  the original thought in this movie   br    br   i cant see the point in making carbon  celluloid  copies .  br    br   a     rating by macaulay connor  
i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film   br    br   as it  s obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it  or were stupid enough to pay to see it .  br    br   the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back . elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can .  br    br   it  s an ok monster flick  compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made . way better      
now i  ll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair  so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie .  br    br   that about sums it up too . i disliked this movie . to be more specific  i disliked the concept of this movie . the cinematography was good . the mood was nice . and the acting was satisfactory .  br    br   however  the story is fatuous  unacurate and misleading . it is also offensive .  br    br   i am a quarter cree indian  and for some reason i feel insulted  on a personal level  by the nature of whitaker  s character . first of all  he  s a black guy . and this isn  t a racist remark  i swear . the thought of a white  hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents . the katana represents the soul of a samurai  imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai . for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside  and where the heck did he get a katana anyway  it must be one of those replicas  which insults the samurai caste even more .  br    br   also  ghost dog showed no honor . near the end of the movie  he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain . not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy  it  s more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists  but hates none  the  less .  br    br   then he tries to kill his boss  when he finds out his boss is a baddie . you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable  he kills himself  to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master .  br    br   everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido .  br    br   so  we have great cinematography  good ambiance and so  so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise   which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it   making it an unsatisfactory overall film  and an insult to everything a honorable bushi  samurai  holds dear .  br    br    .     bleah  
i was around  when i saw this movie first . it wasn  t so special then  but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun  a lot   br    br   i think the best parts of the film are yeti  s body language and the  special effects  also .  br    br   if you wanna watch this movie  don  t wait for a hollywood made blockbuster  even this film was made from approx .     dollars    br    br   i  ve a copy of it . movie and video version as well  but i don  t think it had been ever shown in cinemas   br    br   watch it  enjoy it    yeti for ever     
  don  t bother to watch this film  would be better advice  if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles . this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast  not just marilyn .  br    br   the story was just nothing  certainly nothing like described on the vhs box  of course . there simply was no suspense  precious little excitement and too many dull spots  most of them trying to show why  nellie   monroe  was so messed up . this was not a good role for monroe  even though i didn  t need to see this character to know she could act .  some like it hot  alone was good enough evidence for me . but this role just didn  t fit her and it  s no surprise it wasn  t one of her more popular films .  br    br   it  s also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark  anne bancroft  elisha cook jr .  jeanne cagney  donna cocoran and others .  br    br   summary it  s not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game .  
most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm . not so this gloriously bent  batty and berserk over  the  top italian  made shot  in  canada kitsch gut  buster it  s a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over  baked  what the hell  s going on   crackpot excess and inanity .  br    br   a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a    foot yeti that resembles a hirsute    s disco stud  complete with jumbo wavy afro  perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice . they dethaw the beast  jolt him back to life with electric charges  grossly mistreat him  and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth . before you can say  hey  the filmmakers are obviously ripping off  king kong    our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage  grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen  the gorgeous pheonix grant  he lays lustful eyes on  and storms away with his new lady love . the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience . of course  he breaks free again  nabs the vixen  and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage .  br    br   the sublimely stupid dialogue  sample line  philosophy has no place in science  professor    cheesy  far from  special effects  the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw  dropping awfulness   clunky  mis  direction  and a heavy  handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere  is the yeti a man or a beast   ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen . better still  we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti  s nipples  which causes it to harden and elicits a big  leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth     the vixen nurses the yeti  s wounded hand while he makes goo  goo eyes at her  the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building  and the furry fellow even breaks a man  s neck with his toes     . overall  this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should  be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that  s eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following .  
this is a well  worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman  s noose  then sets about  taming  his reluctant bride . it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time . we never find out  for example  why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband . or why the members of her team are so eager to get a  real man  in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own . this only made sense in fifties hollywood .  br    br   there  s a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip   the second time   then yanks her off her horse . never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye  which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip  then  he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp . that  s some second wind . later  he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians  as they all are in these flicks  after they reject her now she  s his  squaw  . never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she  s been negotiating with them for years . and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him   yeah  right . like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail .  br    br   finally  neither of the leads is convincing in their roles . madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky . fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot  but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy . the only reason you  d root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film  s end . the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow  up dolls . even if you do see them as dolls  the total lack of suspense will bore you .  br    br   total waste of time . even the scenery  s kinda dull . give this one a big miss .  
being a giant monster fan  me seeing  yeti  was an absolute must  especially after hearing so much about it . thanks to the good  ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily  and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually  dare i say  decent .  br    br   decent for what it is  actually  namely a cheesy giant  monster flick . it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately  and we get introduced to various characters . they consist of some sleazy ones  some good ones  and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci  fi film  by far .  br    br   yeti looks like a long  haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert  and really  he  s not that bad of a dude  especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage  like thing . godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening  he doesn  t even rampage  actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture   but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out . yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely  my copy was dubbed in english  and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are .  br    br   however  we want to see the giant yeti do his thing  and he  s pretty much in the whole movie  and in typical low  budget fashion  he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there  s even a bunch of the  fake legs  shots of him just standing there .  br    br   yes  the special effects aren  t the greatest  but there are definitely some good ones here . a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well  and in another  he uses the windows of a building as  ladder steps  to climb down from the top of it  shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside  in one sequence that really looks much  much better than it should in such a  bad  movie .  br    br    yeti  never stoops as low as say   a . p . e .  does . actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti  s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an  oh yeah baby  manner . but even this isn  t that bad  and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer .  br    br   the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing  but surprisingly enough it doesn  t get boring  the story is actually good  and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy .  br    br    yeti  may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks  but it is definitely better than other king kong    rip  offs like  a . p . e .  and  queen kong  by very far .  
to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it  but i  m never one to let others influence my viewings  in fact i  m more likely to watch something out of defiance  . bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway  the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away . the picture isn  t very good  and is in fact very morally dubious  all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form  all motivated by greed or egocentric victories  this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture . sadly it doesn  t  and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can  t help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film  nobody in the cast come out with any credit  with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme .  br    br   not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone       
yeti deserves the  star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made . i saw it at a midnight screening in l . a . and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity  this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does  the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill  fitting suit  the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen  and yes  there is a mute boy  who sorta kinda looks like a girl  and he  s mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents  hmmm  maybe therapy for the kid    . then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti  once he thaws  which takes forever    and he is instantly in love with her  what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes  bedroom eyes  at her  it  s like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie . in fact  once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest  she accidentally touches the yeti  s nipple and yes  the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard     yikes of all yikes  plus there  s a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie  there  s also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish  keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl  s hair  gee  thanks yeti  now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout . you  re the best .  this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up . if you are a fan of classic cinema crap  seek this baby out .  
i  m basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night          . i don  t think i  ll be watching again . the acting was totally wooden  the plot completely predictable  the ending totally unrealistic   i mean who would believe a   million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer  the lead actor  victor garber  seemed so uncomfortable  almost embarrassed in his role   perhaps he realized how bad the writing was   i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor  but they can surely find better writers . maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china   i  ll bet we won  t be seeing this one next season   
stargate is the best show ever . all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles . i love the connection between the characters . if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it . although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can  t be because it is completely different . i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks . unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season   is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time  which is highly depressing  . however this program is very very good and is a must see  but be warned it is highly addictive . so in summery i love stargate  and amanda tapping  .  
beginning with the poster  featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey   the entire movie was a fraud . one stereotype after another  this movie was about nothing  or nothing new  at least . after      minutes  you realize that you  ve just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop  flick .  br    br   basically  the story is about the corrupt system in some city  all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town  under the watchful eye of some hot  shot politician . the almighty and above  the  law organization is called frat and guess what  they  ve got a kick  ass loony cop shooting and beating at will  suspects  girlfriends  you name it . frat cops are corrupt and greedy  so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented      journalist . one hour later  after a series of unbelievably bad  made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines  everything ends happily and we get served the final line  you can  t beat the system . bah  don  t see this waste of film roll . freeman and spacey barely have   min altogether   
people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs  congo  king kong vs . godzilla  king kong        they all ripoff one another  but yeti stands on its own . it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal  s attraction with one female .  br    br   the yeti myth is based on bigfoot  not like king kong  and archeologists have been fascinated it  at one time they did exist  but there is no scientific data to prove it .  br    br   this movie is hard to find  but its worth watching it . the first time i watched it was on  elvira  s mistress of the dark shows  in the early      s . it sent chills down my spine as a kid  especially when the yeti got mad . i saw it again  around     am on abc about  to  yrs ago . seeing it again made me appreciate it more  it has some overall good effects  for its time  and the story involves a mute boy and his dog  and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes . also the music is pretty cool  its very yeti like .     br    br   gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere .  br    br   vote  and half out of   .  
happened upon a copy of this . not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i  d be finding those responsible and demanding it back  all i can say is this would be a terrible student film . any understanding of the medium of film is absent . acting is god awful  the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame  and the change in tone of the lead character  s reaction to the  ghost  is laughable .  br    br   i can only agree that the  glowing  reviews of this film are from friends and family . i  m afraid it  s not even entertainingly bad .  br    br   amateur in the extreme   br    br   avoid  avoid  avoid   
here  s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite  fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity . this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip  off of the already bad movie classic king kong from     that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness  but successfully predicted much of peter jackson  s miserable     computer cartoon bearing the same name  as far as a  romance  between the giant  here a yeti  and a gorgeous human female  antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi  s city of the living dead  who is very easy on the eyes  .  br    br   the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex   the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package  the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness . but as a trade  off you do get a wacky old scientist  two inquisitive kids  tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain  a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure  dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while  and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti  who turns out to be the good guy  glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands  a monster who  s size literally changes scale from shot to shot  some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison  crowd reaction shots a  plenty made up of either spanish  italian or canadian extras depending upon scene  you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed   and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie .  br    br   it  s here that the film won me over it  s enthusiasm just for being made . frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in     and god  s gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action  adventure genre film scene from the      s       s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work . i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever  or rather the one he took the most chances with  and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families . the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless . or rather they are part of the fun  and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn  t have worked   which is exactly why peter jackson  s movie sucked .  br    br   he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators  and with all it  s faults  clunkiness  kramer  s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this  which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages  not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space . i  d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it  curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever . because the movie looks so  fake  you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked  trampled  tossed about and smashed . knowing that and armed with a fertile  energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie  parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend . this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid .  br    br         it  s about ten minutes too long but who cares  you only come around once and i  d rather go out with a smile on my face .  
frankly i  m rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering . have they all been written by his pals  the action clunks along  the music is irritating and over used  the script is simply dire and the actors  with the exception of the gardener  mediocre at best . i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it  s brilliant when it  s not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i . e . continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture . yes  it  s his first film  low budget etc .  i get it  but it  s also out there for members of the public to purchase and it  s just not up to scratch .  
having seen most of ringo lam  s films  i can say that this is his best film to date  and the most unusual . it  s a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick  ass martial arts  where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters . the action is fantastic  the story is tense and entertaining  and the set design is truely memorable . sadly  burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next  to  impossible to get your mitts on  even if you near the second biggest china  town in north america  like i do  . if you can find it  don  t pass it up .  
it  s one of those dramas that  s so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny  the script is absolutely dire  direction appalling  lighting purely armature  the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it  s good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard  but doesn  t at least destroy any speeches . there  s continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout . and finally last but not least the acting is appalling . for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this .  
i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies  but all of them failed to meet my expectations . . . until now  burning paradise doesn  t contain the flat humor most hk movies have  nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film . the story is not complex  but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some  intelligent  space  the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger  but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me  . there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie  from the first one  which is one of the coolest i have ever seen  yet so short  to the last main scenes  but mind  there  s also a lot of blood that flows  people cut in half  decapitated  etc  . the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical  notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall   . yep  it  s not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film  it  s ringo lam  and i  m sure as hell going to check out more from this director  ace .  
when thinking about captivity many words come to mind . among them are uninteresting  unentertaining  unsuspensful  unsexy  unfathomable  and unwatchable .  br    br   i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics . they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing  but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they  re aimed at feel like they  re hardcore and hip .  br    br   this movie is a load of boring crap  what the hell has happened to larry cohen  his name hasn  t been attached to anything good since      even so  i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad  was anyone surprised when the movie  s love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths  did anyone not know it when they first saw him  only someone who has never before in his or her life  ever seen another movie   
  br    br    burning paradise  is a combination of neo  shaw brothers action and ringo lam  s urban cynicism . when one watches the film  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn  t matter  it  s attitude and atmosphere that counts . this great film has both   always trying to be different than his contemporaries  lam gives us to traditional heroes  fong sai  yuk and hung shi  kwan  and puts them in a  raiders of the lost ark  setting . however  these are not the light  hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie . instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results . what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime  there is no holding back . too bad  they don  t make films like this more often .  
i  ll keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl  s drink  imprisons and tortures her  then poses as a captive to have sex with her . that is the single twist and punchline of the film . it  s torture as slow motion date rape . and  it  s not even a good movie . it  s not so bad it  s good it  s just bad .  br    br   it should also be mentioned that among critics  there is a  spoiler code  that they dare not break  even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile . why no one had the cojones to step up and say   this is garbage  and this is why   is beyond me .  br    br   don  t give your money to these poop  peddlers .  
an unusual film from ringo lam and one that  s strangely under  appreciated . the mix of fantasy kung  fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes . a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse . several horses get chopped up . it  s very unexpected .  br    br   the story is very simple  fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple . the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood .  br    br   the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak . blood is everywhere . the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time . sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it  s never bad enough to ruin the film .  br    br   find this one  it  s one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties . just remember it  s not child friendly .  
the only reason i give it a  is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on .  br    br   this film is asinine . it  s like so many other   st century grind house fodder . the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting . i didn  t care about any of the characters  but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap i  d complain about the money i spent  but my date and i wisely left after   minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining  live free or die hard   which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of  captivity  for   minutes .  
hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones . the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers . as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes . where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure . sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood .  
absolutely fantastic .  br    br   now  before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latts  allow me to elaborate . much as i enjoyed it  this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i  ve seen at the cinema  an impressive claim  as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen  . the two leads  daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert  were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst . of course  they weren  t helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne  celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence . the plot  to stretch the term slightly  was thin to non  existent and the  gore  scenes  whilst undoubtedly brutal  were irrelevant and laughably formulaic . what plot there is revolves around a twenty  something model  cuthbert  who is abducted  imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures  both psychological and physical . the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience . whilst there really are very  very few positives to draw from this film  its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film . i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . within twenty minutes  the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout . for my part i came out flushed with laughter  buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film  making . whichever way you look at it  this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film .  br    br   p . s . i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free . . . so i can afford to laugh about it . i was still tempted to ask for my money back . . . it really was that bad .  
this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong  s  new wave  that began with tsui hark  s  zu warriors of magic mountain  . tsui set a tone for the new wave  s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  jackie chan  sammo hung  wong jing  ching siu tung  etc .  accepted from then on as a given namely  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony  if not outright comedy .  burning paradise  put a stop to all that  and with a vengeance .  br    br   it  s not that there isn  t humor here but it is a purely human humor  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw . but this is just as humans are  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time .  br    br   when irony is at last introduced into the film  it is the nastiest possible  emanating from the  abbot  of red lotus temple  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before . he is the very incarnation of milton  s satan from  paradise lost    better to rule in hell than serve in heaven   and if he can  t get to satan  s hell soon enough  he  ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule .  br    br   that  s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it  s not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair  to feel utterly hopeless  to accept his nihilism as all  encompassing reality . thus there  s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself  it has become all there is to the universe  and the abbot  claiming mastery of infinite power  is in charge .  br    br   of course  fortunately  the film doesn  t end there . though there are losses  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails .  if you want to know how  see the film   yet there is no doubt that  in viewing this film  we visit hell . hopefully  we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience  and somehow better for it over all .  
the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor  a holocaust survivor  part of mengele  s experiments on twins  consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz  and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments . the movie obviously had great reviews . it  s one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about .  br    br   i too  for a large part of the movie  got sucked into the emotion that the movie  maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on . one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder  obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum  could only find the sweetest nectar .  in one of the many dramatic sequences  as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center  the meaning of the word  forgive  is even debated  but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own  but by this time  the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more . after the  strong  willed  eva kor forgives her  nazi captors  the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about  at least from the viewpoint of kor . the movie goes about following her  past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory . to me  this was the meat of the movie  surrounded by inedible fat of her  act of forgiveness  . obviously  it was a very sick cow .  br    br   on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness  in order to heal wounds of the past  she makes her way to the  promised land  to meet with some arabs  to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis  including one at a jewish center in chicago . from then on  anyone not so teary eyed that they can  t see the screen will find it hard  pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements .  br    br   firstly  you immediately notice her body language  defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers . her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time  effort and money the entire act was . a rather annoyed dr sami advan  professor of education at bethlehem university  gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment .  br    br   finally  the debate at the jewish center in chicago  where she is  grilled  on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so  in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts .  br    br   i will cut to the chase . by the end of the movie  i was hoping i hadn  t chosen to watch the movie . the movie was badly made  failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial  just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears . it showed that kor  the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion . her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness  at best  to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate .  br    br   lastly  is everyone so retarded today that they can  t notice the difference between making peace and forgiving  quoting another imdb user   i don  t see her forgiveness as being weak  quite the contrary  she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul  she wanted the suffering to be over  so she let it go .  that would be the perfect layman  s definition of making peace .  br    br   i guess  in a world of propaganda  blind faith and political correctness  there is no room to question those that have  gone through more than the human mind can fathom  .  br    br   p . s . the dictionary certainly should go into all those books  to  buy lists everyone keeps making .  
people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie  and this movie is no exception . some movies i love did poorly at the box office but  i  m glad to say  this movie isn  t one of them  over nine million dollars  which i don  t think was bad for back then  . the characters were fun  the animation was clear and not fuzzy  and the music was modern  too  which is unusual for an animated movie . i didn  t think professor screw eyes or his  scary cirus  was too scary for little kids  the targeted audience for this movie   but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids  movie . overall  this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years .  
this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning  but never fleshed out to it  s expectations . the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas  typical of the asian directors   but doesn  t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film  never finding a solid  explainable  interesting angle . basically  the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . the acting was very good  however . all the actors gave good performances  and jude law was outstanding as he is always is . it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .  
i disagree with anyone who done  t like this movie .  br    br   i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do . it  s sweet  funny and warms your heart . and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed .  br    br   and even though it didn  t have much of a story  it was still excellent i give it a   and two thumbs up .  br    br   oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish  s and dreams can come true .  tear  tear   br    br   i love this movie  personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say  shame on you .  because it was a delightful little movie and i  m glad that at least some people liked it .  
jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value . completely lacking in eroticism  excitement  or leading ladies with appeal . one decent fight  a few moments of mild suspense . and a one  note plot .  br    br   the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law  s character and a dogged homicide detective  well played by timothy spall . but despite their best efforts  both actors are staked to the cross of the film  s banality .  br    br   with a lesser actor in the lead role   and without the benefit of oliver curtis  s cinematography   crocodiles would blend into the sea of low  budget vampire quickies .  
this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years . i will sadly miss it . although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit .  br    br   the last ever episode of sg   on television anyway  was beautifully done . robert wrote something that felt close to reality . as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show .  everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up  s and downs . but over the years they  ve turned into a family  . i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else  s criticisms .  br    br   sg  was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement . the wonderful characters  stories  directors  writers . from episode one i was hooked . the blend of action  science  drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more .  br    br   there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me . i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years . it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible .  br    br   i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them . i never want the show to die .  br    br   stargate sg              
ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected  he did a fabulous job acting as a  renegade  cop within a  renegade  department . from the very beginning  he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he  s in . he acts as a sort of  gentle giant    a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody  yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start   and he does an amazing job . he was quite clearly the best character in the movie .  br    br   this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards . after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down . his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor   and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner . there are so many ways his character  moses ashford  could have taken a more pivotal role . that he didn  t was disappointing and a true let  down . i was hoping to see more from him in this film .  br    br   timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry . his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive . this movie is a typical action movie that  at least initially  bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past . being an action movie  it has its share of shoot  em  up scenes  blood  and guts . these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable . watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end   think of what you would typically expect in a good  cops  bad  cops conflict   and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot  out .  br    br   what irked me most was the way timberlake  s character behaved during shoot  out scenes . he starts out having guns and not using them . then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he  s been firing a gun his whole life . then he runs out of bullets and doesn  t have a gun   and   seconds later  without moving or anything   suddenly has  more fully loaded guns and extra ammo   little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me .  br    br   if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay  then you  ll probably love this movie . personally  it doesn  t matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic . make me believe that the story is true . this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied .  
genre dinosaur  animation  new york  time travel  circus .   br    br   main characters rex the tyrannosaurus rex  elsa the pterodactyl  dweeb the parasarolophus  ooo the triceratops  a boy called louis  a girl called cecilia and captain new  eyes .  actors john goodman  rex   yeardley smith  cecilia   martin short  stubbs the clown   felicity kendal  elsa  etc .   br    br   what happens four dinosaurs  see above  are fed some  brain grain cereal  and are now cuddly  friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children . they go into new york  with big plans  br    br   my thoughts this is a cute animated film . the animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not  so  good  but they look pleasant all the same that way . i like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly  they are nice  friendly and good . i like  almost  all the characters featured  especially elsa and cecilia  but of course i like the others as well . overall  i like this film a lot      br    br   recommended to people who like good children  s animated films  people who like dinosaurs  john goodman and people who think that circuses aren  t always what they seem enjoy      
i love all types of films  especially horror . that being said  survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it .  br    br   i can  t give it any points on originality . there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes  or remaking what others have done . it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods  a crazed killer  and as of lately  throw in some crazy family . on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw  wrong turn  though the twist in that one is obvious   and others . survival falls up way short against comparable films . the plot was just not original in any way . some films can get by with a weak  and way over  done  plot with superb acting  special fx  or a slew of other factors . survivial doesn  t have any of that to bank on . if you will  note the following the acting in the movie never took off . i don  t knock or blame the actors for that  nor the director . the dialogue was at best mediocre  and the actors involved never showed  not saying didn  t have  the talent to pull it off . i mention  standouts . the leading man in this film certainly has the look  but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film . the actor who portrayed greg also had potential  but we never got to see any of it  watch the movie to see why  you won  t believe it . .  .  br    br   the grainy film look . ah yes  that little tid  bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of  grindhouse  films . in today  s film making  that has become a gimmick . it either works or it doesn  t . in this case it just does not work . there are too many other flaws going on  so it winds up distracting from the film  not adding to it . that being said  i think they did a good job of adding that grain . that is some good  quality grain . i think with a different script  better direction  and possibly actors  they should try another  grindhouse  attempt . they will probably pull it off .  br    br   as far as the tech aspects  in my opinion  they never quite gelled for me either . better care could have been taken with audio  sounds like it was fed directly into the camera  but there is nothing wrong with that  and for being shot on dv  it was too soft for my taste .  br    br   that is all i have to say about that . . . . .  
i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart  but i was flabbergasted when i saw the  .  rating to one of my childhood favourites . it doesn  t wow me as much at    but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie . kids will definitely love it and won  t mind the flaws  and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film . none of the film was preachy in any way  in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness . i will admit though that the story is on the thin side  and some scenes like screweyes  s death  which still freaks me out  may be a tad on the scary side . but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation . the music by james horner is very beautiful  and the song featured is memorable  catchy and amusing . i really liked the characters  louie is probably the most in  depth of them all  but the dinosaurs were at least engaging . martin short  s clown was both hilarious and emphatic  the part when he tells screweyes  i quit   had me in stitches . my favourite is screweyes though  an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent . if anything though  i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could  ve been more developed in terms of depth . the script  while not oscar  worthy  has its funny and heart  warming parts  and should keep kids and adults entertained . the voice acting for me was what made the movie . john goodman  martin short  rhea perlman  felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances  but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable . all in all  this is a good movie . i don  t get the rating  honestly i don  t . sure this film isn  t perfect  and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time  but it is good fun .  .     bethany cox  
this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness .  br    br   i don  t even have the vocabulary to say how dire  turgid  boring  confusing  and just plain strange this effort is  hey what d  ya know i do . . . .  set in a post  apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue  it was all so incomprehensible i couldn  t make head or tail of any of it .  br    br   seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is awful .  br    br   and not in a its so bad it  s good cult way .  br    br   it is just awful  awful  awful  awful .  br    br   honestly . if you still don  t believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think . even gerbils on acid couldn  t hope to understand this .  br    br   avoid or even better destroy . . .  
i saw this when it first came to video  my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably   at the time . . . what stood out for me was the lack of mid  movie conflict that so many movies have  where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don  t say the one thing that you  re shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal  that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . this is what i like the most about the movie i guess  that the main characters don  t do mean things to each other halfway through . . . they don  t break up and make up  they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on .  br    br   these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track  they  re not that different . loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family  and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . anyway  i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again . . . sure there  s plot holes if you analyze the script and no  woog and dweeb shouldn  t be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality .  br    br   now  what detracts from the film is it  s unexpected scariness . little kids under the age of  would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr . screweyes . and  the addition of him halfway through the movie  though it  s blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance  is too abrupt . . . there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie  perhaps to show that it  s not that scary without the the dinosaurs . i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie  so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half .  br    br   considering the target audience  who i  m sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues . . . i think i  ll give it a pass on those factors too  and just enjoy the story . it  s a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind . . . makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every   years i think .  
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . well there  s nothing wrong with that  except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together .   percent of the cast are white males about same age . it  s almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves . the movie has no plot . it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath . there are some funny scenes and comedic bits . but they don  t redeem the flat monotony .  br    br   the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do  and not done very well at that . anything that can  t be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation .  br    br   i went to see this film after seeing the trailer  which makes it look like a tarrentino piece . well  the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get . ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane  inane comedy . it works at times  but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over . it  s more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie . it  s a hit  you  over  the  head  with  it kind of comedy . i can see where the story idea is intriguing . but  in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england . in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era . he plans to make a part  . i guess he thinks he  s tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing .  br    br   at the opening in la  wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part  . he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one  to which he replied  well yea  sure .  
its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn  t copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids  if they like dinosaurs that is  i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a  but right now is a little late for that yay  more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don  t want it to be spoiled don  t read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any  
this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched . do not rent  the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie . it starts with some what of a plot  then fades fast to nothing . i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover . the actors were awful  the plot faded fast  filming left to much work to be done . not one good thing to say about this crap movie . if you rent this movie you will waste your money . i really enjoy national lampoon movies  but this was a waste of time . learn to write  learn to act  learn to produce  and learn to direct . i feel i should sue these a  holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost .  
i wouldn  t call  we  re back  a dinosaur  s story  simply a kiddie version of  jurassic park  . i found it more interesting than that . like the former  it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours . but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman  rhea perlman  jay leno  walter cronkite  julia child  kenneth mars  yeardley smith  martin short and larry king . to paraphrase that a given actor  the  cheers  woman  the  tonight show  host  the most trusted name in news  a famous chef  the  young frankenstein  police chief  lisa simpson  one of the three amigos and the cnn guy .  br    br   but i guess that i shouldn  t focus only on the cast . i thought that this movie had something for both children  purely fun  and adults  natural history  . true  it  s escapism  but the perceptive kind . i would actually say that john goodman doing rex  s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in  monsters inc  . worth seeing .  
i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word  there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j . fox    we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and     bills    if i ever let anybody use a room for some  afternoon delight  time i  d be fired on the spot  the organization to which i belong  les clefs d  or  has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously .   similarly untrue was the concept  at the end of the movie  of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee  we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them . there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization .  br    br   this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary . in short it does a disservice to our organization . i welcome any comments .  
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young  it had everything that was great with    s kids movies . . . lovable dinosaurs  cute kids  an eccentric villain  and a few great songs  and not the typical little mermaid  beauty and the beast type songs  but ones that are atually entertaining   i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever  i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie  and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations  sorry not the most informative  i  m in kinda a rush . . . just please  trust me . all who go against this movie are killing their inner child   
i expected alot from this movie . kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie . i can  t even explain this movie . it had wooden acting  terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes  tidal waves and earthquakes . but that was at the end  the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn  t . this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest . the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings . the whole movie is missleading and boring . one of lees worst .  
this movie has to be my favorite of all time . its not supposed to have a plot  because its makers wanted people  charlie sheen  i think  to believe it was a real snuff film . this was an exercise in visual effects  and doesn  t cut away when the action happens like every other film does . movies these days are now all about sound effects  leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood . there still are movie makers who still can  t get fake blood to look like the real thing . there is no rape scene because that wasn  t the point of making the film . have you seen the hills have eyes   the rape scene was funny instead of shocking . although i  m sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . but since they probably suck at making films  they probably wouldn  t be able to pull it off . the movie  baise moi  has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks .  br    br   its too bad that a movie can  t be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all  especially when talking about an ao or nc    rating . i  m sure eli roth has the ability  talent to make his hostel film series much much better  but he has too tame it down to get an r rating . . . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations .  br    br   watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage  accident  crime scenes  footage  . don  t forget that this movie was made in     . the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . that would be like someone saying the  bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps  has better graphics .  
end of the world is an uneventful movie  which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth . the main character is some kind of scientist  i  m not exactly sure what kind . he has two jobs at a government    facility guarded by four security men . his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space  although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job    . job   requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room . . . at least that  s the best i can figure . apparently the  plant  is not exactly top  secret  as the scientist brings his wife there . she hangs out  they  re on their way to a dinner  while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption  repeated over and over . he says something about it being the first message from space he  s ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they  re going to be late for the dinner party . so they leave and go to the party      . moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake . from there  the movie goes . . . nowhere  yes  christopher lee is in it  but that really doesn  t help much . besides  lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii . this movie is boring  but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z  grade sci  fi . plus  there  s lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed .  
this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of . the japanese people    who star in this must have been really desperate for a job  or we  re just friends . here  s the scoop  br    br   three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman  they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her  they burn her  kick her  spin here around in a chair  over    times    they use sound torture  by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over   hours  it don  t sound that bad at all  but it can make you go nuts  . they throw guts  probably from an animal  at her while shes knocked out  and she freaks when she wakes up . and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen   br    br   if you have not heard of these films  and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film  you will think it is   just ask charlie sheen  this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick  like i said pure underground . check it out if you are a fan of underground horror  or foreign gore . if your not i highly recommend you read  up on the series before watching  from the gore  shock  and creativity aspect it gets a    but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a  . an underground classic . . .  br    br   my final rating is a      br    br    
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen  its horrible . christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it  the only the good part is the opening scene .  br    br   don  t be fooled by the title .  end of the world  is truly a bad movie  i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad  only for die hard b  movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit .  
i first heard of this movie after purchasing the     flick  snuff  . i was told that devil  s experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set . i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one  so my interest was peaked .  br    br   devil  s experiment is a short film with no story  no character development . just  men torturing a woman for about   minutes . they torture her in various ways like beating her  spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol  forcing her to listen to hi  pitched noise for   hours  smash her hand with a mallet  burning and putting maggots on the burns  throwing guts at her  and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye .  br    br   i must say that a lot of this movie was fake  like the beating scenes . but then  some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out . the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it . or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for   hours is painful to think about . the worst is the eye scene . i didn  t shutter when watching it but simply thought  damn  that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie  . i did enjoy the flick but i don  t know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer .      
end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad . being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled . like tentacles     a good cast does not mean it  ll be a good film . the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium  many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on . the rest of the cast is shown briefly likelew ayres  dean jagger  and macdonald carey as a security guard . i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re  animater and dolls . i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film . he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer  john carridine  and dean jagger . well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it  lucky them  if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline . dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwardsalligator     and game of death     sue lyon  lolita  is also in the movie minus her lollipop . if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie .  out of   .  
this is the first out of the guinea pig series  and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection .  br    br   it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films . i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date . so i popped this sucker in and sat down .  br    br   from what i had read on the internet  and realizing the content involved in this film  i was expecting to test my nerves in full force . this ended up not being the case .  br    br   the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point  and how long a human can tolerate pain .  br    br   sounds like one sick flick right  wrong . the film fails to shock . this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror  but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease .  br    br   on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen . though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence . including the ripping out of fingernails  intestines thrown at an unconscious woman  and a needle through the eye .  br    br   overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it  but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one .  
what can i say about this film other than  don  t see it  . i waited and waited and waited for someting  or anything  to happen and it just didn  t come . watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie . what are they doing  are they solving a mystery  are they gathering clues  possibly  it  s just hard to tell . at the end of the movie  after a lot of radio signals are decoded  illegibly on some sort of pet monitor  and this guy gives some lectures  the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible . some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth  i guess they don  t like sharing the wealth  . my guess is they finished filming and saw their   minute work or art  garbage   and decided that they  d let the editing crew turn it into an   minute feature film . watch at your own peril  it  s not even funny because it  s so bad  it  s just bad .  
i haven  t always been a fan  but the show grew on me . it wasn  t until after season  that i started to see the richness of the show . they finally brought daniel jackson  s search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go  ould system lords were killed by rival lords  sg   or others .  br    br   towards season   stargate sg    was beginning to become stale . with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise  the show became more and more solid .  br    br   the characters had become stale as well . colonel jack o  neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage . after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o  neill  s weapon  he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go  ould ra . the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself . only allowing his close friends in .  br    br   amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter . she was a feminist on the edge  ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job . though this character had little area to grow  tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter  s strengths . she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently .  br    br   christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal  c . teal  c was an alien called the jaffa . infant go  ould   snake like creatures  would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form . the jaffa would die . teal  c was the first prime of apophis  army . knowing that apophis was not a god like go  ould pretend  he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy . finally  having had enough  he and jack o  neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people . after arriving on earth  he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for  who would help him fight the go  ould . christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character . teal  c is a wise warrior  much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra  tac . the show would not be complete without master bra  tac played by tony amandola . he is also a rock . in the end  he became adviser to most of sg    especially daniel jackson .  br    br   don s . davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand . davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal . he does his job  has a wife  sons and daughters and grandchildren . you can really say  he is the anchor of the base . simply  i would die for that man . if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world . he will go himself . he doesn  t leave anyone behind .  br    br   i saved dr . daniel jackson for last  because this character  i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on . in choosing shanks i don  t think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson  they don  t talk about spader  they talk about shanks . in the early years  the jackson character came off as a whiner . that  s why i probably wasn  t a fan . as the seasons pasted  the character became stronger . this gave him confidence . in the end  as of season    the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero . he still monitors the groups ethics . he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward . acheaology  history  culture and exploration are part of his very being . he is determined . though a man of peace  he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement .  br    br   other characters include  most recently vala mal doran  claudia black  and colonel cameron mitchell  ben browder   new lead of sg   . both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess . i see little difference between mitchell and crichton  farscape character  . black  s character is simply off the wall . definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon .  
i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations . the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good  right  how wrong i was .  br    br   i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey  a director  writer of wiseguy making his feature debut  blah  . . . well the director  writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man  because i cannot see how he  along with the other actors in the film  would ever agree to be in this disaster .  br    br   this movie is absolutely appalling  it  s a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich ever . there is nothing new with edison . the acting was bad and the direction was even worse . it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy . this was the best casted direct to video movie i  ve ever seen .  br    br   some examples of just bad silly moments in edison . . . morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music . . . justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles . . . llcoolj driving a vintage firebird . . .  guys being shot in the head . . .  br    br   this movie is the opposite of good .  br    br   stay away from edison   
guinea pig the devil  s experiment is without a doubt  stars on first view  its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature . this movie gets right to the point  you may be thinking what point  the point is to satisfy fan  s of just extreme violence and gore . this movie has some gore  more or less just torturing a women violently . there are really only  scene  s that could be considered gore . i  ll tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil  s experiment makes hostile look like sesame street . if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain  t seen the half of it until you  ve seen guinea pig the devil  s experiment .  br    br   movie rating     gore      br    br   guinea pig the devil  s experiment  uncut       
dull  cheap sci  fi thriller  made with an almost total lack of conviction  a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man  and is very poorly guarded at night   and full of campy sound effects . christopher lee is not only wasted  but he also gives one of his few  i  m here strictly for the money  performances .        
i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie . . . i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best .  br    br   even though ive seen the  making of   i still have doubts when watching those   mins of pure torture  its that powerful .  br    br   a   out of   because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do  be the best fake snuff film ever made .  
a good deal of running around . a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity . a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them  gets caught up with aliens . along with his pretty wife  he invades their territory and is given secrets about them . he becomes rather traitorous in the process . granted  he is given little choice anyway . there is a scene where he gives them everything they want . this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens . the plot isn  t technically bad . it  s just that we are usually following a car  a trip through a woods  investigating a building . this is what editing is all about . i suppose the story wouldn  t technically support much more . not much here .  
after having watched  guinea pig   two questions come in mind  besides  am i really a psychopath to watch that      is it a snuff   the answer is no  although it  s the closest thing to a snuff movie i  ve ever seen . and then   where the hell have they found that girl   . because she gets tortured for    min  without any reasons given  in fact  there is nothing else in this movie    fingernails teared off  beaten with hands  feet  tools  infested by maggots  . . . and many more until the final scene  i  m still not sure how they did that  . because it belongs to the  japonese underground scene   it  s obvious she didn  t get a lot of money . so what were her  their  motivations   br    br   i saw it in japonese without subtitles  but it  s not a problem  no real dialogues  the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes  . i haven  t seen yet all the serial  but the first  guinea pig  is not known for being the best one . still i  ve rated   because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff  the issue is quite good  ask charlie sheen  the actor  . but i think they could have gone further  which they did in the following ones .  br    br   another movie i  m hiding from my parents .  br    br        
  a scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters  occurring across the globe . hoping to discover the source of these signals and who  s behind them  the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals . what the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be   according to the dvd sleeve  s synopsis .  br    br   kirk scott  as andrew boran  is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer . he suspects a series of  large earth disruptions  may be connected to the weird space static . mr . scott and pretty blonde wife sue lyon  as sylvia boran  investigate the mysterious signals from outer space . they discover priestly  but creepy christopher lee  as  father pergado    and other silliness . given that   end of the world  is remarkably dull .  br    br    end of the world       john hayes  kirk scott  sue lyon  christopher lee  
this movie has no story . it  s only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death .  br    br      spoilers     br    br   this is what they do they beat her  put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood  spin her around on a chair until she pukes  expose her to loud noise  pour boiling oil on her  put worms in her sores  crush her hand with a sledge  hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye .  br    br   this movie was so realistic that if i didn  t know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff  movie . although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it . it scared me . i guess it fills some kind of purpose . i give it a      .  
christopher lee is one of my favorite actors  i  m trying to view all of his work . he has been known to single  handedly save movies with his presence . unfortunately  this is not one of them . this movie suffers from a low budget and it  s production values are disturbing . please . . . for the love of christopher . . . . avoid this film   
i have seen the short movie a few years ago . after that i watch all sequels . the first one is really not the best  but it  s the most popular one . i  ve already watch the making of guinea pig  . it  s really great what these guys did . also the sequels are excellent in the special effects . take your chance to watch it   
spoilers  br    br   wow  end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience .  br    br   here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space  a la independence day  . the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china . he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he  s trying to figure out who  s receiving the messages  and who  s also sending out messages in space  . he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent . they visit it . everything looks normal  including the priest played by a bored christopher lee . but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent . so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens  disguised as priests and nuns . they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet . once the alien get the special element  the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform . lee  being the last alien left  tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens . lee walks in the transporter and he  s gone . the couple  looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world  decide to follow the aliens . because earth is doomed  the couple doesn  t see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear . the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding . the end .  br    br   that  s it .  br    br   i  ve never seen such a dull movie in my life . it  s the most underwhelming movie i  ve ever experienced . the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen . they don  t care about anything . they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide  what the heck  who needs earth anyway   they don  t even try to stop them or do something to make things better . this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent . the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces  so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work . i wasn  t expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production  but i didn  t expect it to be this bad .  br    br   christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions . well  i  m sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun . starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining . end of the world is much  much  much worst it  s beyond dull and inert  with no entertainment value whatsoever .  
this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best . at the same time  it looks realistic and unrealistic  just knowing that the movie is fake . the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways . a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address  and it includes a manga video  showing the torture . the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die . some scenes are shocking  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched    times  because you see punches in nearly every movie . this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people   or older .  br    br        
it  s got christopher lee  it  s got huge banks of     s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen  it  s got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises  it  s got volcanoes  evil aliens disguised as nuns  tidal waves  earthquakes  exploding cars  exploding coffee machines  and as a climax the entire planet blows up . how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly  mind  numbingly dull  the answer  my friend is because    of this movie is made up of establishing shots  most of them involving long tracks  pans  or zooms in combinations  or occasionally all three  that do nothing except give the crew something to do . there are endless shots of our protagonists driving  getting in and out of cars  driving again  walking around looking at stuff  getting in cars and driving . . . i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering  say something  please somebody  just say something . . . do something . . . anything  . . .   br    br   the dialogue  when it does come  is terrible .  br    br    maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours .  was a typically meaningless line . the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage  justified in this speech from lee as the head alien  br    br    the planet earth has emitted an over  abundance of diseases  they are contaminating the universe . all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed    br    br   this is is neanderthal sf script writing . this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of      s japanese monster suit movies aimed at  year olds . it is  and i collect such things  the most god  awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired . it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters .  br    br   lee  who always struck me as a smart  useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits  delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek . i don  t blame him .  
the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape  complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame . it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black  clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers  her hand smashed with a hammer  her eye punctured with a needle  and so forth .  br    br   in the most nauseating scene  the woman  s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns . the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen  believing the series to contain actual murder  attempted to ban its distribution in the united states . an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers   sick re  creations using nasty  but obvious special effects . gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic  book artist hideshi hino  who also directed the third and fourth episodes  this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms . but  gorehounds probably won  t find anything special .  
your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller but  pray  who  s will  a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people .  br    br   small  apocalyptically themed outing  end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely    s similar movies . and it  s not only that  but eotw plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well . the villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor .  br    br   this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation  that significantly    s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated . anyway  the convent  s secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco  christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride   
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said  well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks . how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know . im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was . however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real . and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me .  
this film had a great cast going for it christopher lee  dean jagger  macdonald carey  lew ayres   solid b  movie actors all . but this downer of a movie didn  t use any of them to any sort of advantage  with none of their characters even meeting on screen  though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes  .  br    br   the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat . first  they just want to repair their ship and leave  then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need . then  out of nowhere  this  peaceful  race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many  diseases   though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society  .  br    br   most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing . you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end  just in vengeance for boring us to death .  br    br   unless you really like chris lee or seventies low  budget sci  fi  i  d give this one a miss . it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo target earth .  
wow  alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here . wonderful . my name is steve and i run unearthed films . we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america . now before you ask why am i writing a review  instead ask why some people bash it . i  m writing this review because i love the guinea pig films . why do i love em  it  s because they go for the throat and they don  t let go . i  ve seen it all . almost every horror film known to man  argento  fulci  bava  buttgereit . from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster . i  ve seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films . why because it doesn  t try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the  st place . this review is for the devils experiment . i find it devoid of story which is fine by me . why do i watch horror films  so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people . the devils experiment not only delivers but that  s all it is . pure unadulterated violence . yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold . why do people bash it . cause they like a story  so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story . it make em feel better about themselves . we all want blood and gore . it  s just really hard to justify it if it  s not wrapped around a story . the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released .  br    br   i  m thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world . maybe i shouldn  t have written this review but then again maybe i should . my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it  s not . i  ve always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films . sure it  s exploitive and over the top but isn  t that why we watch horror films in the  st place . the devils experiment is not for everybody . it  s for thrill seekers and gorehounds only . if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those . but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you . there is a reason why they haven  t been released for over   years . they are wrong  disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom  unless she is totally cool . good luck  enjoy and never stop living your life .  
the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns . christopher lee  who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved  is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine . the cast are not too bad  though most have now retired from acting . the film has terrible sound effects  mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems  and it ridiculously pondering at times  showing a scene of the sky  for instance  for what feels like hours at a time . despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world  is  doomed sort of way and the production is adequate . interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band  s assistant bennah burton . despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it .  
a lot of people unfairly sh  t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining . devil  s experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work   not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic   especially for the video  s vintage and low  budget .  br    br   let me start at the beginning now for those who don  t know this film is an  extreme  torture  fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid    s . it  s plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is . this entails brutal violence   all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl  s arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound .  br    br   the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground . these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings .  br    br   the actress who plays the victim of the  experiment  is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera . her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling . some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest . also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes .  br    br   if you haven  t seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot .  .     for devil  s experiment .  
i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial . the commercial was great  but it i found out later that it had every explosion or  special effect  in the entire movie  about   and even some that weren  t in the movie . there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember . it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people . i guess my world of innocence ended that day  when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies .  
my rating refers to the first  seasons of stargate sg   which are wonderfully fresh  creative and addicting . when the cast stepped through the gate  you never knew what lay on the other side  starting around season   the show took a different focus  still good  but different .  br    br   the series follows the adventures of a team of humans  and one alien  who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the  stargate  . the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie  stargate  in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt .  br    br   the episodes are light  innocent and easy to watch  and very creative . many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci  fi movies of their own . what happens next was always unpredictable .  br    br   the characters on which the show rests are also well  defined and brilliantly performed . their tone is serious  but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . they are simply fun to watch .  br    br   starting somewhere around season   the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe  the goa  uld  then the ori  . the plots become more complex  a lot more political  strategic oriented  and interdependent . the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature .  br    br   one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the    th and    th episodes . they are simply can  t  miss shows . they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through   seasons .  br    br   if you are a sci  fi fan  watch a few episodes of the first  seasons and you  ll likely be hooked . if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides  you have   seasons of shows to look forward to .  
that is the only question i am left with . why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast  why was the writing so bad  it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters  why did it not make any sense at all  why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and  hollywood  the hell out of it when all it needed was good  smart story telling  why  i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they  re released . i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey  who are oscar winners  that this never is released to the big screens in america .  br    br   as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism  the whole story is just utterly laughable . i just . . . think the script had potential  but the execution turned it into a clich  and an awful one at that . just . no .  
the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black  clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . she is beaten savagely  spun around in the chair endlessly  has her finger nails pulled  animal guts are thrown at her  hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle  really sick and nasty scene  . the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . i have seen also  flowers of flesh and blood  which is more gory and sadistic  but less disturbing . anyway  this one is a must  see for horror fans   
this movie was terrible  i rented it not knowing what to expect . i watched the  st  minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb . the acting was bad and there was no plot . the monster is soooooo fake . it growls and its mouth doesnt move . also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster . just plain bad don  t even waste your time .   out of     
first off  this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to . the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema  apparently its the other way around . if one were to look back after the film it really wasn  t meant to be convincing  it was a low budget ipecac . but really thats all it was aiming for  it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value  and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions  .  br    br   i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific  in non  shock sense  it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid  pessimistic  i didn  t trust anyone for about a week because i didn  t want to wake up strung up and tortured   
wow  i just saw this on t . v . as one of the  scary  movies they show around halloween . was this rated g  there wasn  t really anything to make this movie scary  or worth watching . also  other people say this is a spoof  but i don  t think so . for a spoof  you need something called  humor  . this low  budget crap  fest didn  t have a shred of humor  and it didn  t make much sense  either . you basically have a goofy looking monster  man in rubber suit  coming out of closets  killing people  i guess  since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath . the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster  so i guess that  s good enough .  br    br   the military tries feebly to kill the monster  which isn  t much larger than a man . they have very bad aim . then the military flees  wow  did this movie make the u . s . military look pathetic or what  the monster  while hard to kill  doesn  t do much besides shuffle around and roar . oh  and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks . it was a slightly interesting  yet a total alien ripoff .  br    br   what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster  it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality . also  why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long  why didn  t the monster go into the closet when it had a chance  why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless   
just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion . every line  every phrase  every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con  man  so well cast .   out of     
now  i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching  in the same way that you watch a car crash . . .  br    br   i appreciate the fact it  s a spoof  but that should not stop me from criticising the god  awful directing  acting and dialogue . seriously  this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen  it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper  and a poor one at that . . .  br    br   okay  a few criticisms    when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster  we never see the monster attack him  so we assume its a heart attack   the army then launch shells  rockets  bullets at the monster  which was feet from the doctor  yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive    the army attack from about    yards away  and we see a flame  thrower being used  geez  those things have a range of no more than   metres     when the monster tries to take the professor  the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid  and the soldiers don  t try to shoot the monster    come on     the monster looks like it something out of power rangers     there is one scene where the five  good guys   the priest  the girl  the doctor  the reporter and the kid  all look shocked and we get reactions  along the lines of hand to mouth  one after the other  so natural     the general just runs away  time after time    the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn  t listen    the acting is awful    did i mention the rubber suit monster         that god  awful music  non  stop   
  house of games  is a flawlessly constructed film  and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends . i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert  s review  which proclaimed it the best film of     . i had my doubts  mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year . boy  was i in for a surprise . this was one of the smartest  most well  written movies i had ever seen .  br    br   the screenplay is quite a piece of work  not only in terms of the plot  which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out   but also in terms of character development . on my second viewing  i began to realize that mamet  s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film  but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations . the climax of the movie is particularly effective  because it is absolutely inevitable . it stems naturally from what we know about the characters  and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending . the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film . i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike  and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset . their work  plus mamet  s extraordinary screenplay  combine to create one of the greatest films of the      s . it is truly a must  see .  
yes  the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro . it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature  stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . add in harry andrews  with a strange accent  no less  chasing an ostrich  tons of stock footage of wildlife  and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard  and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .  
just watched the film for the  rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before . it just keeps getting better and better . you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech  the slow deliberate action  everything being exactly in place .  br    br   truly one of the great ones and definitely my all  time favourite     
the head of a common new york family  jane gail  as mary barton   works with her younger sister ethel grandin  as loma barton  at  smyrner  s candy store  . after ms . grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves  ms . gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore  as larry burke  must rescue the virtue  threatened young woman .  br    br    traffic in souls  has a reputation that is difficult to support  it isn  t remarkably well done  and it doesn  t show anything very unique in having a young woman  s  virtue  threatened by sex traders . perhaps  it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length  claimed to have been ten reels  originally  . the new york city location scenes are the main attraction  after all these years . the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable  because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move .  br    br    traffic in souls           george loane tucker  jane gail  matt moore  ethel grandin  
unique movie about confused woman  lindsay crouse  who gets involved with sharp con men . joe mantegna gives an oscar  caliber performance as the slickest of the group . absolutely enchanting first hour  as mantegna shows crouse  the ropes  of his con games . story line unravels a bit later on  but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world . definitely worth a shot .  
kirstie alley  looking a bit slimmer  but only a bit  is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike  bleached blond hair and all . the premise of the movie is about an older woman        who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer . not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting  inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot . there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie  s character and why this is included is a mystery . the actor who portrays kirstie  s brother is so wooden and miscast  it was torture to watch their scenes . what is there to say about this film . avoid it .  
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part . a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game .  br    br   have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong  watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way . sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators . you  re never sure of who is exactly who in this movie .  br    br   this is both a quality and a drawback of the script . as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency . but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling .  
  st watched             out of    dir  jon keeyes   over  the  top rehash of    s supposed horror flicks like friday the   th  versions  thru whatever  . i can  t think of much redeeming here except  or can i think of anything   the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an  homage  to this  supposedly . but  lo and behold  one of the stupid people  have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered  again  how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this  . guess what  the murderer is at it again and we  re tipped off from the very beginning who it is  so there goes any mystery whatsoever  . and besides all this  where are the  cops  and why doesn  t someone call them . i can  t believe this movie was financed by someone and made . you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher  at least in their movie  going experience  but not so by this filmmaker .  
plenty has been written about mamet  s  the house of games   most of it good . i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after   years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again . the film  s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam . mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us  the audience  and the mark simultaneously . then he explains the art of conning only to do it again  etc . all the while building the story .  the house of games   now a freebie on cable  is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans .  b   
this piece ain  t really worth a comment . . it  s simply the worst  horror  movie i have ever seen . the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry . shame on you i say    
this typical mamet film delivers a quiet  evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man  joe mantegna  good . explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist  lindsay crouse   it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences . the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet  s films  steven goldstein  jack wallace  ricky jay  andy potok  allen soule  william h . macy   and they do their usual good job . i loved lindsay crouse in this film  and have often wondered why she didn  t become a more noted player than she has become . perhaps i  m not looking in the right places   br    br   the movie proceeds at a slow pace  with flat dialog  yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang  up ending . you  d expect a real let down at the ending  but i found it uplifting and satisfying . i love this movie   
without a doubt this is one of the worst films i  ve ever wasted money on  the plot is  erm sorry  did i say there was a plot  the scariest moment was when . . .  nope can  t think of one  the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was . . .  nope can  t think of one for that either . you knew who the killer was right from the start . there was nothing scary about the whole movie  in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister  misty  in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off . this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie     
in the spirit of the classic  the sting   this movie hits where it truly hurts . . . in the heart  a prim  proper female psychiatrist  hungry for adventure  meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals . the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman  and begs to be involved in his operation . while the movie moves kind of  slow   it  s climax and ending are stunning  you  ll especially enjoy how the doctor  forgives herself    
this movie is outrageous . by outrageous  i mean awful . i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke . the acting got progressively worse as the  movie  advanced  and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached . when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem . that was not intelligent . truthfully  stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed . if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie  bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends .  
i enjoyed this show for two reasons  . richard dean anderson  . amanda tapping . these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors . the replacement of rda in seasons     was enough to take the heart out of the show .  br    br   the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous . you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling . this relationship carries over into the program we get to see .  br    br   rda gives his  o  neill  character believable personality . he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest . you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances . still  they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous .  br    br   there is a lot going on between  carter  and  o  neill  under the surface . they manage to keep the lid on  but often just barely . the episode  solitudes  in season  had some of the best drama ever seen on television . the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together .  br    br    carter  and  jackson  often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by  o  neill  . yet  o  neill  s  tactical instincts always seem sound . he understands what to do without having to think about the matter . the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders .  br    br   the quality declined markedly in seasons  and   . the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest . ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show . he had his rare moments with claudia black  but that was all . amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons . you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby . she was probably thinking more about the child than the show .  br    br   the spin  off  stargate atlantis  has a few moments  but is mostly a weaker effort . the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original . the villains  wraiths  are so improbable as to be ludicrous . maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won  t last beyond the fourth season .  br    br   there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show . to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci  fi . the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad . the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra  modern technology is just as hard to accept .  br    br   i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too . in the season  opener   daniel jackson  is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded . he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet . the episode  hathor  has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc  yet it is never mentioned again . this device could have been used in several later episodes on  daniel    o  neill   and  dr . frasier  .  
wow . i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast . justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had .  br    br   his acting was painful to observe . the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors  heck  even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on . how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend .  br    br   his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass  and he is supposed to be the hero . . . i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video . maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at  am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned  this may be ok .  br    br   watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human  kermit the frog  act in a hollywood blockbuster  just didn  t work at all .  
a film destined to be on late  night tv long after the present instant  money  makers  have long been forgotten . perhaps a little too subtle for today  s youngsters  but in time they  ll grow into an appreciation of this movie .  
  american nightmare  is officially tied  in my opinion  with  it  s pat   for the worst movie of all time .  br    br   seven friends  oddly resembling the k  mart version of the cast of  friends   gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare  a pirate radio show . it  s hosted by a guy with a beard . that  s the most exciting aspect of his show .  br    br   chandler  monica  joey  and . . . oh wait  i mean  wayne  jessie  and the rest of the bad one  liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj . unbeknownst to them  a crazed nurse  serial killer is listening . . .  br    br   crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and . . . wait  sorry again . . . by making their fears come to life . these fears include such stunners as  voodoo  and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures .  br    br   no . really .  br    br   this movie was  in a word  rotten . crazy nurse  s killing spree lacks motivation  there  s nothing to make the viewer  jump   the ending blows  and   again   voodoo   br    br   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones  rent  american nightmare  with them .  br    br   if you care for your loved ones   even a little bit   go to your local blockbuster  rent all of the copies of  american nightmare  and hide them in your freezer .  
this movie should not be compared to  the sting   or other caper  heist  con game films . what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships  deceit and trust . it  s also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry  given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale . has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy  highly  hugely recommended   
this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen . the acting was terrible  horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot  i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone . what a waste of time  first  as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into . all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie . the prank phone calls  halloween night  a psycho  and one knife  its absolutely ridiculous . i was not scared at all during the movie  which i thought horror movies were supposed to do . as for the making of the movie  its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary . i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of  scary movie  for example . at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie .  
ask yourself where she got the gun  remember what she was taught about the mark  s mindset when the con is over  the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning .  br    br   when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her   thousand .  br    br   the patient was in on the con from the beginning .  br    br   mantegna does not die in the end  the gun had blanks .  br    br   there  enough spoilers for you there  this is why people are giving it such high ratings . it  s extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience .  
when i read the back of the dvd case  i thought that it sounded really interesting . . . so . . . i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the   for   dollars  section at blockbuster . when we got home and popped in the movie . . . twenty minutes into it  we found ourselves turning to each other going  this sucks . let  s put in something else .  i  ll admit  a few of the lines from the friends at the caf made us smile a little bit . but come on  at least get some decent actors  every once in a while in a movie  if the acting is bad and the movie isn  t going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting  i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they  re over  or under  doing their lines . but i can only take so much . crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter  there was no delivery for their lines . . . amateur doesn  t even come close to the acting in this film .  br    br   anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie . it  s the most pointless thing i  ve ever had the displeasure of watching . do not watch or buy this movie       
i  m a big fan of films where people get conned  and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the  films where people get conned  genre . in short  it  s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels  and never truly revealing what  s happening  while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you  ve just seen . the film cons the audience on many occasions  and despite us knowing this it  s still difficult to guess where it  s going  and every twist comes off as a surprise . as mentioned  i  m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler . she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient  and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con .  br    br   house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout  and david mamet does well in establishing his film  s setting in the underground levels of the city . the film is well acted also  with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill . joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film  and although his performance is a little under wrought  he  s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece . lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work  and again is believable in her role . she may not be the greatest looker  but at least she can act . the way that the film executes it  s plot is the main star of the show  however  and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer . at times it  s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film . another thing that  s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons  which is useful if you  re interested in making twenty bucks  say . all in all  house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride .  
when it comes to horror movies  i am more than willing to suspend disbelief  ignore sub  par production values  and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare . this movies simply has no good scares to offer . it can  t even be enjoyed as camp . bad dialogue  bad acting  bad direction  the kills were predictable and poorly staged  the music was annoying  the camera work was wretched  even the costumes were bad . i felt really bad for the actors  who were obviously trying  but who had to deal with terrible  contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction . i doubt they got any rehearsal  either . it  s embarrassing to watch  and so boring than making it through to the contrived  surprise  ending requires tremendous endurance . it  s quite easily one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen .  br    br   i don  t normally write reviews  but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others . this movie is a complete waste of time . if you must watch this movie  don  t miss the  making of   featurette . the writer  director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold  daring move .  seen it .  he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it  s a new  age  citizen kane .  it  s like listening to a group of third  graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant . they truly think they  ve created something of substance . it  s sad  really the only reason i gave this movie a    is because i think    should be reserved for true atrocities  like  manos hands of fate  and  space mutiny .  so  american nightmare  isn  t the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but i  d have to say that it  s somewhere in the bottom fifty .  
spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters . but who is conning who here  when does the hunter turn into the prey  this gritty  dark movie is slow moving and seductive . it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path  only to waylay you just as you think you are safe .  br    br   it has a riveting script  with good acting  at least from the leads  . i didn  t notice the background music  but it was never jarring  so it must have been done right .  br    br   i was very surprised that i liked this movie  because i don  t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end .  
in texas  seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party . meanwhile  they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears . a serial killer  who is listening to their confessions  makes their nightmares come true  killing each one of them in a sadistic way .  american nightmare  is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation  a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area  as if it were friday    th . then  the story shifts to a bar  where seven friends are celebrating halloween . from this moment on  the story has a great potential  and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance  showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies  as usual in this type of c production . however  the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan  giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting . with a better beginning and conclusion  this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie . my vote is four .  br    br   title  brazil    agonia    agony    
get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time . i am relatively unaware of david mamet  s  writer and director  other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times  it  s always a joy to watch   i can say without hesitation that he is a genius . this film is extremely well written  and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit  con  artistry and back room hustles . the feel of the film is very similar to the sting       and it also pays homage to film noir .  br    br   it  s quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters . it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch .  br    br   generally  the acting is superb  especially joe mantegna  but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it  s not a good idea to have a heroine  lindsay crouse  who is not only a gambler  a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad    s hairdo . i agree  but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role .  br    br   the less you know about the plot of this film  the better  just like mamet  s most recent film  the spanish prisoner  because the ending will be even more impressive . just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance .  
the premise is amazing and the some of the acting  notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp  is charming . . . but this film is near unwatchable . the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap . most of the singing is off  key . i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it . . . the dialogue is really stupid and trite . the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub  plots . i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after   wondering  when is it ever going to end .   
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama . all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  and the performer  intrigued and entertained applies to this film . there isn  t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad . mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor . if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited .  
so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film  and you might be thinking to yourself   huh . there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december   .  funny thing is  most of these rave reviews sound like they  re coming from the same person  or at best a small  coordinated group of  open house  groupies . the truth  my friends  is that this film is truly unwatchable . just because it  s  independent  doesn  t mean it gets a free pass . if you  re going to make a musical  whether on film or on stage  whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse  you should probably make sure that  a .  your actors can sing   b .  your actors can dance   c .  you have decent sound equipment   d .  you have a well  written score  and  e .  you have lyrics that are witty and charming . even anthony rapp can  t save this one . it  s one of those unfortunate movie  going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved .  
this is very nearly a perfect film . the ideas would be repeated by mamet  but never told so succinctly . this is really about the failure of trust  of the human condition . the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals  no one is innocent . is there anyone alive today who hasn  t seen this play out in our own society  every single day  the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller . except  there are no more innocent characters . the world is now completely polluted  ruined and everyone is participating in the con . could anything be more true   br    br   don  t miss the soundtrack . it is wonderful .  
i feel totally ripped off . someone needs to refund the   .   i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess . this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening . what i don  t get is why did this get distributed in the first place    . . . somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made . i  ve seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact . the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view . . . shot on dv    nuff said . the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section . want to see a good musical  then don  t rent this movie .  
  house of games  is definitely not without its flaws  plot holes  stiff acting  final scenes  but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head .  house of games  does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do . of course  this is not a huge feat given the fact that we  re dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate . so it stands to reason that we never really know what  s going on  even though we think that we do . but that  s what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities .  br    br   it has a definite hitchcock slant to it . the film draws on some similar themes found his     effort  marnie   considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master  s more thought  provoking works . one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse  s character being the same as tippi hedrin  s . . . ten year later perhaps . both are strong  willed loners  both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool . as crouse  s repressed  up  tight character says   what  s life without adventure   put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks   
the single worst film i  ve ever seen in a theater . i saw this film at the austin film festival in      and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival . it was an interesting premise  and seemed like it could go somewhere  but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything . first of all  if you  re going to do a musical  find someone with musical talent . the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming . the lyrics were terribly written  and when they weren  t obvious rhymes  they were groan  inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work . and you  d think you  d find people who could sing when making a musical  right  not in this case . luckily they were half talking  half singing in rhyme most of the time  but when they did sing it made me cringe . especially when they attempted to sing in harmony . and that just addresses the music . some of the acting was pretty good  but a lot of the dialog was terrible  as well as most of the scenes . they obviously didn  t have enough coverage on the scenes  or they just had a bad editor  because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film . at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical . i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again .  
wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it  s hopeless to help her patients . a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better . here she gets involved with joe mantegna . to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and  house of games  may very well be the best con movie i  ve seen . david mamet wrote and directed this gem that  s full of snappy dialogue  great one  liners  and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end . crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con  man . and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie  the film is in utter control of it  s audience and we are loving the con .  br    br    out of   
this movie was so terrible it was almost good . . . almost . we love musicals  but not this one . even with the terrible sound quality  poor cinematography  and many actors who can  t sing or dance  anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance  especially toward the end  . the character marjorie  a drunk lady  was enjoyable to watch  too .  br    br   the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music . admittadly  some of the songs  fantabulous  are pretty catchy  but not in a good way  .  br    br   open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful  we think it might be a good stage musical  with excellent actors  .  
i  m not great at writing reviews  so i  ll just spout my opinions . . .  br    br   i loved this series at first . the adventure  the action  the comedy  the drama . . . i thought it was all brilliant . anderson  tapping  shanks  judge  davis . . . i loved them all . davis  it seemed  was the fifth  most important person in the cast . not a big deal . but when his character  general hammond  left at the end of the seventh season  and anderson  s character  colonel o  neill  moved from the field to the office  the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff . i don  t know whether it  s because hammond was more important that i realized or what  but for some reason  after the seventh season  the series turned to  .  br    br   the first seven seasons  though  were awesome . the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it  but it turned out to be  even if this wasn  t the original intention  a brilliant setup to the series . i recommend that you watch the movie first  then watch the first season of the tv series  then watch the movie again  you  ll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around  believe me   and then watch the rest of the tv series .  br    br   the last three seasons of the series aren  t nearly as good as the first seven  but that doesn  t mean they aren  t good . it just means they  re a letdown if you  ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons .  br    br   after you have finished this series  be sure to watch the spin off series  stargate atlantis . it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series .  br    br   edit on         i just found out that don s . davis died a few weeks ago . it is a great loss .  
normally  i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest .  br    br   you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet . . . well  this movie was just terrible . it is nigh on impossible to  suspend disbelief   i tried  really  i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn  t let me .  br    br   timberlake should stick to music  what a dreadful performance  no presence as an actor  no character . can  t blame everything on justin the movie also boast a dreadful plot  badly timed editing its definitely an  f  .  br    br   after seeing this  i have to wonder what really motivates actors . i mean  surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part . did he not see how poor it was  what then could motivate him to take the part  money  of course  acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work .  br    br   ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script .  br    br   meanwhile  the audience goes  what the hell is going on here  you expect me to believe this crap    br    br   in short  apart from justin a great lineup badly executed  very disappointing .  
house of games is spell binding . it  s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens . there are few movies i  ve seen that can grip you so quickly . from the opening scene this movie just gets you .  br    br   i  m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don  t read anymore if you don  t want to know .  br    br   i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen  bar none . from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed .  br    br   lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection  from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately . joe mantegna was also wonderful . the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices . i also loved the way the movie was filmed  in that grainy  surreal type of way  it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was .  br    br   there were a few movies i  ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really  house of games is completely different in it  s way . margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i  ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet  but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying . you know something  s going to happen but you have no idea what . and just when you think you  ve guessed what the  something  is  you realize you haven  t even scratched the surface . . . .  br    br   house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature . the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well . as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters  we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it . it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it  s conclusion .  br    br   in closing  i  d rank this   of    call it  although not my absolute favorite film  pretty high on the list   most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best  twists  i  ve ever seen as well . although i love all types and genres of movies  when it comes to movies of the human psyche  it really doesn  t get much better then this . see this movie .  
did heidijean really see this movie  a great christmas movie  not even close . dull  bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart . i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie  the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance . baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing . probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with . maybe i  m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played   days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie .  
here  s my first david mamet directed film . fitting  since it was his first  as well .  br    br   the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie  from the little cons to the big cons to the all  encompassing con . it  s like  the grifters   but without that film  s level of acting .  in that film  john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character .  the acting here is very flat  i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis  . at least in the beginning . it never gets really good  but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes . early in the film  some of lindsay crouse  s lines   the way she reads them   sound as if they  re inner monologue or narration  which they aren  t . with the arrival of mantegna things pick up .  br    br   the dialogue here isn  t as fun as it should be . i was expecting crackerjack ring  a  ding  ding lines that roll off the tongue  but these ones don  t . it all sounds very read  rather than spoken . maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up  but if not  then maybe he should let others direct his words . he  s far too precious with them here and as a result  they lose their rhythmic  jazzy quality . what  s more strange is that other than this  the film doesn  t look or feel like a play . the camera is very cinematic . my only problem with  glengarry glen ross  was that it looked too much like filmed theatre  but in that film the actors were not only accomplished  but relaxed and free . everything flowed .  br    br   i wouldn  t mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines   or even play characters speaking play lines   but here it sounds like movie  or even book  characters speaking play lines . it  s a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn  t work . that doesn  t mean the movie is bad   it isn  t  it  s often extremely entertaining . the best chunk is in the middle .  br    br   it  s standard con movie stuff the new guy  in this case  girl  margaret ford  lindsay crouse  gets involved in the seedy con underworld . how she gets involved is she  s a psychiatrist and one of her patients  billy is a compulsive gambler . she wants to help him out with his gambling debt  so she walks into the house of games  a dingy game room where con men work in a back room . i  ll admit the setup is pretty improbable .  were they just expecting crouse to come in  were they expecting she  d write a cheque  was billy in on it  one of these questions is definitely answered by the end  however .   br    br   and from here the cons are start to roll out . i found the beginning ones   the little learner ones   to be the most fun . we  re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is .  br    br   we see the ending coming  and then we didn  t see the second ending coming  and then the real ending i didn  t see coming but maybe you did . the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling .  br    br   i  m going to forgive the annoying opening  the improbable bits and the strange line  reading because there are many good things here . if the first part of the movie seems stagy  stick with it . after the half  hour mark it does really get a momentum going . if you want a fun con movie  then here she is . if you want mamet  go watch  glengarry glen ross  again   james foley did him better .  br    br     
carly pope plays jj  a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant  overbearing mother moves in with her . jj  aghast at this turn of events  then blackmails restaurant owner  alex  to entertain her mother in exchange for  maybe  reviewing his dying restaurant . alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother . there are numerous problems with this movie  the characters are universally   dimensional . jj is a self  serving  hateful character  her mother superficial and shallow . jj  s colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic . the underlying message of an over    woman unable to make it on her own  without male assistance is bad  bad  bad . the acting is uniformly dull  the script uninspired . the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city . i would so not recommend this film .  
if your idea of a thriller is car chases  explosions  and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire  then  house of games  is definitely not the movie for you . if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense  then  by all means  see it .  br    br    house of games  tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer  dr . margaret ford  lindsay crouse   who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike  joe mantegna  . to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense . frankly  i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming . just like a clever con artist  this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance .  br    br   the story is taut and well  crafted  the dialogue smart and laconic  the acting uniformly good  mantegna is superbly charismatic  . some have complained that dr . ford is not a very sympathetic character  and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive . but dr . ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover  her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot  at one point  i believe that an injury to her sexual self  esteem is a key part of her motivation . . . i  ll say no more  .  br    br    house of games  is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity . it will hold your attention every second while you are watching  and stay with you for a long time afterwards .  
i wasn  t expecting this to be a great movie  but neither was i expecting it to be so awful . i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel . i turned it back  hoping it was just one part of the movie  but no . and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed  or almost done out of a job  or driven to madness inside her own home  are you kidding me  i was raised to respect  and even fear  my mother but i  d put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house . i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother  s house  after all .  br    br   i didn  t buy any of it . i tried giving it several chances  i really did . sorry .  
house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels . it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller . it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna  and a strong  strong cast of supporting players  and it introduces ricky jay  card sharp extraordinaire  prestidigitator and historian of magic . its dialogue  written by david mamet  is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie  in which reality is often in question  an extra dimension of unrealness .  br    br   on the face of it  house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men  diametrically different from the sting  which was played merely for glamour and yuks . at this level it does succeed admirably .  br    br   however  you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization . the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin . that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus  hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs . house of games sticks to its business . as poe once said of a good short story  it drives relentlessly to its conclusion .  br    br   there is another strain of movies  about  women  epitomized by thelma and louise  a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed  whether or not they realize their inner strengths . what tripe .  br    br   as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater . it should be a natural for film festivals . nominate it for one near you if you get the chance .  br    br   i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my   year old daughter . better she should see it on a tv than not at all .  
i hate to sound like an  old person   but frankly i haven  t seen too many movies that i like that were made after     . . . generally  movies just seem to get worse and worse  although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle  the bread  my sweet   except for the  de rigeur  sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie  . this movie makes the mother  a former las vegas chorus girl  seem to be incapable of surviving on her own  although she is clearly in her   s  though hinted at being in her   s  . i didn  t buy it . i  m   and like all the women i know in their   s and   s  more than capable of surviving on my own  as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at    got legally emancipated and set off on my own life  s journey .   br    br   the daughter is not believable in her job role . . . she gets a promotion she doesn  t deserve  a great opportunity  and drops that ball too  but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver  the writers shoot her down as an  opportunist   when she was just doing what any career  oriented person would do   taking advantage of a wide  open opportunity created by the lack of self  discipline of her coworker  a girl who apparently doesn  t understand the concept of honoring her promises  to her boss  in this case  .  br    br   the daughter grudgingly  allows  her mother to stay with her  on a temporary basis  but then treats her mother  the woman who gave her life and raised her to  adulthood   like a pariah . apparently the  writers  of tripe like this do not understand that it is not  the common thing  for parents to act like children  and then be treated as children by their children . that is just more of the societal  baloney  that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we  their public  were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings .  br    br   this is a sad movie with a stupid ending . if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two  dimensional  tv character   he  d have stayed with the mother  who was not that much older than him and quite attractive . but in the end he  falls  for the daughter  a shallow  rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth  but in an ordinary  bland way .  the  opportunist  young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive  physically .   br    br   there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter  who was an uptight  selfish  self  centered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect  to the mother   a woman who was kindhearted  sweet  tempered  humorous  and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend . of course the mother had her own flaws . . . she had reacted to her husband  s demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter .  br    br   regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed  this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney .  where  s the mustard    
the united states of kiss my ass   br    br   house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller . it stars lindsay crouse as best  selling psychiatrist  margaret ford  who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide . in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown  to visit the lowlife place  house of games .  br    br   the gambler mike  played excellently by joe mantegna  turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty . he offers crouse  s character a deal  if she is willing to sit with him at a game  a big money game in the backroom  he  ll cancel the patients debts . the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work  gaining the trust of others  and a fascinating relationship begins . what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control  is it the psychiatrist or the con  man or is it the well  known man of great bluffs david mamet .  br    br   in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring  however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings  not the direction . in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads  showy and distracting  but mainly as is the case with much of mamet  s work  it is the dialogue  which grips you and slowly draws you into the film . no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words . everyone bluffs and double bluffs  which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order . this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension . house of games can also be viewed as a class  war  division movie . with lindsay crouse we have the middle  class  well  to  do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite  the working class of america earning a living by honest  crime .  br    br   the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema . and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for  it  s stunning .  br    br   an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings .      
having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style  technique to match the larger scale of this movie . i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard  hitting fact  based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities  but this is not it . this plays like a bottom  to  mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the   s  e . g . ss experiment camp etc  perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually  . granted it has a greater scope and more people running around  but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non  actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots  spiced up with the occasional poorly executed  shock  sequence . the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power . watch channel   s  the holocaust   aired recently  still running    as of  no      for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war  featuring excellent in  context use of actual footage  . this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves  not this hackneyed exploitation garbage  a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine  but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie  . rating    as exploitation   as a treatment of the subject  .  
david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games   a character study fraught with psychological overtones  in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game . margaret ford  lindsay crouse  has a successful practice and has written a best  selling novel   driven .  still  she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life there  s an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve  and it primes her vulnerability . when a patient  billy hahn  steven goldstein   confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers  and that they  re going to kill him if he doesn  t pay  she decides to intervene on his behalf . this takes her to the house of games   a seedy little dive where she meets mike  joe mantegna   a charismatic con  man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world . instead of the twenty  five large  that billy claimed he owed  mike shows her his book  and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars . and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean  if she  ll agree to do him one simple favor  which involves a card game he has going on in the back room . in the middle of a big hand  mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone  her job is to watch for the tell  of one of the other players . by this time  not only margaret  but the audience  as well  is hooked . the dialogue  and mamet  s unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines  is mesmerizing . as mike leads margaret through his compelling  surreal realm of existence  and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game  we are swept right along with her . from that first memorable encounter  when he demonstrates what a tell  is and how it works  to the lessons of the short con   to the stunning climax of this film  mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless . and nothing is what it seems . in the end  margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature  and about herself . she changes and whether or not it  s for the better is open to speculation . mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows  and does . crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid  up  tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm  self  assured exterior  and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her  she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated . she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does  and makes you understand it  as well . the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum  joey   lilia skala  dr . littauer   j . t . walsh  the businessman   ricky jay  george  and william h . macy  sergeant moran  . house of games  is the quintessential mamet he  s written and directed a number of high  caliber plays and films since  and will no doubt grace us with more in the future . but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up . you  ll find it under perfection .  this is one great movie you do not want to miss . i rate this one      .  
although  i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie  this sure as hell wasn  t what i would have had in mind  had anything actually come to mind . once i heard of its existence  all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don  t eat the babies . unfortunately  i could only find a copy under its alternate title  island fury . looking back  i guess i could call it a lose  lose situation . on one hand  i still don  t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don  t eat the babies  and on the other hand  island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful  pointless  boring  unwatchable piece of garbage . yeah  definitely lose  lose .  br    br   i  m not even sure what genre they  re going for here . just early    s badness  with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non  flashback . first up  two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys  once caught  the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string  around her neck  and somehow  these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere . and this is where things start to get weird  somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island  years earlier  when they were only   . i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is . so  now  we  re in the past  while the girls try to retrace their steps  so these bad guys don  t kill them  although  i wouldn  t have minded if they had . in the flashback  the   year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends  eventually stopping by an island for some air  they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents . any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up  but the flashback was undeniably better than the present  which  still  isn  t saying much .  br    br   for a while there i had forgotten about the original story  at one point  i ithought maybe the director had too  and when the flashback ended  that would be the end  which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half  hour shorter . this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end  and real stuff does happen  but it  s stupid . i guess i didn  t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured  or anything like that  but i did expect some form of outlandish b  entertainment  mostly just a confusing  inept storyline  unsure of its genre . my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures . if anyone  i would only recommend this one to serious b  movie collectors who must have them all  anyone else interested probably has brain damage . what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don  t eat the babies .      
this movie is amazing  while being funny and entertaining  it is also profoundly deep and eye  opening . i will watch it again and again . bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life . he has a job and a life  but it isn  t what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness . bruce is bitter  unsatisfied  and resentful that his life isn  t the way he envisions it should be . as a result of this state of mind  bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life . god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers . bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted . his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy . . . . . with one exception . in the process of gaining everything  he loses the one person who truly loved him . as the movie unfolds  bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances  but his perception of what was truly there . this movie was inspirational and deep . if you really pay attention  it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize . as my wife says   since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy   and my humble addition   may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out .   
roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on . all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family .  br    br   this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better . as much as i didn  t like  barracuda   that  s on the same dvd  i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane .  br    br   eye candy one pair of tits  they might belong to kirsten baker   br    br   my grade f  br    br   dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive  in food and trailers for  bonnie  s kids   features nudity    the centerfold girls    part  time wife   features nudity    psychic killer     eaten alive  . the dvd also comes with      s  barracuda   
this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for . if you watch t . v .  then you might as well not watch the movie . almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews  except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one . it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny . just don  t go see this movie expecting to be surprised . all in all  if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must  see  otherwise just watch the previews and you  ll be just as satisfied .  
this is available on a  drive in double feature  from dark sky films  and since i just had finished up  barracuda   i watched this too . this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time .  br    br   we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town  but where exactly are they  they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor  and try on chinese  style clothes at a shop  but then we see some aztec dancers  and all the while  these girls are being followed by two guys  who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn  t have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town  and they finally catch them .  br    br   it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck  and these guys want to find the loot  and where did she get it  so  in flashback  we go back to find out . and how did they know she had this coin  hard to say  really .  br    br   now  back in the day  when these two women were   years old  they were out with their sisters and their sister  s boyfriends on a boat  and after stopped to get air in their tanks  they tow this young boy back to his home dock  only to have his grandpa come out  invite the  young  uns  up for herbal tea with granny . but not everyone has the tea  todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls  and then when they  re away from it  the boat blows up  and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared . well  it seems as though these  kindly folk  raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell  and serve it herbal tea .  br    br   but the girls and todd did leave the island  but now  they  re returning  escorted by their captors  and they  re there to find the treasure  despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before . there also seems to be someone else on the island  and the thugs mysteriously begin to die  one by one  and since there  s only three  it doesn  t take long . and there  s even a sort of happy ending  which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film .  br    br   the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues  and combined with no acting ability they  re borderline hilarious . the hillbilly  type family is also devoid of acting ability  despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden  who appeared in many films and tv shows . the action is confusing  the locales are even more confusing  and the island looks like southern california .  br    br   so what the hell is this  i  m not sure  but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think  or say   huh   out of    very bizarre .  
i absolutely loved this movie . it met all expectations and went beyond that . i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn  t just randomly silly . it also had a message . jim carrey makes me happy .    
first of all i just want to say that i love this show    but this episode . . . this episode makes a mockery of the entire show .  br    br   i don  t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series .  br    br   there is no story line  everything is chaotic and the jokes . . . . . are crap .  br    br   the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game . . . . . for example  how do the furlings look like  by creating that stupid  previously on . . .  . . . . . . is simply embarrassing .  br    br   its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .  
wow  finally jim carrey has returned from the died . this movie had me laughing and crying . it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from . jeniffer aniston was great  she will finally have a hit movie under her belt . if you liked liar liar you will love this movie . i give it     .  
this really should deserve a  o  rating  or even a negative ten . i watched this show for ages  and the show jumped the shark around series  . this episode  however  is proof that the show has jumped the shark . it  s writing is lazy  absurd  self  indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead .  br    br   it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun   pirates of the caribbean  the mummy  count of monte cristo   all  fun  movies that are not to be taken seriously . however  there is such thing as ridiculous as in  this is the worst thing i  ve ever seen .  and indeed  this is the worst episode of stargate i  ve ever seen . it  s absolutely dreadful  and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement .  br    br   makes me want to sell all of my stargate props  most seriously .  
i have to say  from the beginning  when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn  t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie  with a lot of potential  though the movie wasn  t as  erm  amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens  which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing  even though i  m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people  i don  t remember one line from either of those movies  i  m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts  in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you  ah getting slightly off the point here  well my point is that the that you don  t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series  which unfortunately ended after   amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end  in     .  br    br   though i didn  t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in      and let me tell you  the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series  the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects  were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today . i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn  t for stargate  and my dad  who actually got me into sci fi when i was like   and i  m glad he did  other wise i wouldn  t have seen the brilliant shows like sg   which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies  basically if a new sci fi series isn  t better or as good as sg   its not worth watching . basically this is the best sci fi show to date  and if you don  t watch this  then you have no idea what you are missing   
i don  t remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake  s in  edison .  i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish  destroy the screen  readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism . timberlake is horribly miscast in fact  casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in  patton   or nathan lane to play jesus . but that is almost beside the point .  br    br   timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role . i used to have problems with ben affleck  s acting talent  but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench . with his metrosexual lisp  read lithp   his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like  the   clich expressions for actors   he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly  and no matter how you slice it  i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur  turned  crusader  for  justice journalist . it simply will not fly .  br    br   however  timberlake alone isn  t to blame for his failure . director david j . burke puts him not only in the  essentially  primary role  but also places him aside morgan freeman  kevin spacey  john heard  dylan mcdermott  cary elwes and  i  m surprised he was as good  ll cool j . i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake .  br    br   there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief . a pleasure  if you will . freeman and spacey may not have more than   minutes of screen time alone together  but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so  called hero . dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air .  br    br   but enough of timberlake bashing  words aren  t enough in this particular case to do the trick .  edison  is a very  very run  of  the  mill corruption story . it  s plot ranges from clich to simply preposterous . i do  however  admire the motivation behind making it  which i interpret as an homage to films like  serpico   or  donnie brasco   or maybe even  chinatown .  don  t get me wrong   edison  is not even in the same ballpark as these films  but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence  perhaps to justify my sitting through it .  br    br   the script  in and of itself  features some surprisingly bad writing . yes  it has some decent interchanges  but any conversation between piper perabo  who is wasted here  and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson  s creek episode . it  s your typical far  too  glib  for  reality  let  s  impress  the  audience  with  how  well  we  articulate  and fail  dialogue . this dialogue  mind you  is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments  sometimes it feels like  edison  wants to morph into a music video  where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting  but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds  read slow  motion  .  br    br   thinking about it   edison  is a curiosity . it  s sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn  t work . in film as in most art  if one thing is off  the whole thing feels off . directors must make tough choices . david j . burke missed the mark here . some of the scenes play well in and of themselves  but as a whole  they don  t seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture . and it  s not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with .  
bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show  and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent  hey hollywood  look how good i can act   box office disappointments . it  s great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths . he won  t get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the  awarded films  of the academy . he is at the top of his form in this most recent film  it  s like the return of an old friend .  br    br   carrey  freeman  and aniston all do a great job together  comfortable in their comedy roles  superb comic timing  and obviously having fun together but without the  hey mom  look how funny i am  type of comedy . a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey  s nemesis  carrell of the daily show fame   who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film . i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years .  br    br   i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up  in  arms over the treatment of god  but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs  we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will . without married with children t o complain about  this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities  who know the types  men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television  selling prayers to god  . and  again  about  .   of the country will care and    of the media will report it .  br    br   the bottom line this a purely entertaining film  each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do  and a feel  good feeling at the movie conclusion . a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor . what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry .  br    br   thanks again  jim   it  s great to have you back    
i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago . i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again . the excessive amount of watery  blood  at the beginning is just plain obsolete  not to mention the  whip  around  wind sounds . my friends and i made a super low budget movie  and the effects still exceeded this crap fest .  br    br   as for the amount of mistakes in this movie  there are way too many to count . i knew one of the actors  believe it or not  he was my theatre teacher . ha   br    br   final verdict don  t bother with this  horror  flick .  br    br    stars  out of a possible     
after a slow beginning  bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say . it wasn  t one of jim carrey  s best performances  but he was still ok . morgan freeman was just right as god . jennifer aniston had some good moments . i miss steve correll on  the daily show    br    br   i like director tom shadyac  s choices of movies . he also did liar liar  patch adams  and the nutty professor . in all three of those and in bruce almighty  he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him . a director who knows comedy  can get the talent he gets  and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find .  br    br   my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references . i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie . my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references  but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people . that  s too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity .  br    br   my grade  br    br    out of    
   minutes  and it felt twice that long  brief crossing is not brief enough . indeed  the first   minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue  more of a monologue  really  of a woman approaching middle age  tediously droning about  men   disappointment  sex  aging  and her recent breakup  to a french teenager she met in the ship  s cafeteria .  br    br   the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty  free shop  and to a bar  where finally her self  involved rant pushes him away . the  story  can  t end there  of course  so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin .  br    br   what little romance  sex  or for that matter  anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all . yes  the ending is very nicely done  but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner .  br    br   of course  some people like it . i could be wrong .  
let me start out by saying i  m a big carrey fan . although i  ll admit i haven  t seen all of his movies coughthe magesticcough . bruce almighty was enjoyable . none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end  i dont know what the writers were thinking . somehow i couldn  t help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re  creating liar liar .  br    br   on a positive note  the daily show  s steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast . see bruce almighty if you  re a big jim carrey fan  or if you just want to see a light  hearted  que soft piano music  somewhat funny comedy .  
it has its merit  s morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments . she  s so enigmatic  so original . is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that  s making her so distant and un  relatable  or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary  personally i  d call her dysfunctional .  br    br   morvern is completely detaching herself . disposing of her boyfriend  not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral  she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain . she  s seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed . the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her . although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity . she may as well have killed herself .  br    br   despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director  s shots were superb  the lighting and color made the film visually stunning .  br    br   it  s really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest . it  s little over   minutes but feels a lot longer . they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don  t care about the characters or the film .  
bruce almighty  will sweep the academy awards with a record   oscar wins  it will surpass titanic  as the highest grossing film of all time  jim carrey  s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the     white house playoffs . almighty then  these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers  carrey included  would possess the powers of god . that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey  s new laugh riot bruce almighty  . carrey plays bruce nolan  a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps . god  heavenly played by morgan freeman  grants bruce the gift of god   his powers  in order to challenge him if he can do god  s job any better . obviously  bruce gets carreyed  away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly . carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in bruce almighty  . jennifer aniston was not mis . pittiful  as bruce  s girlfriend . however  my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for    and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time  bruce almighty  is not the most in  depth carrey film  but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of carreyism    good  
my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions  and mostly artsy films that require thought . i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom . my wife has double the attention span that i do . all that being said   this film is just plain empty and boring  it went nowhere . never blossomed . it started fairly strong with a promising plot . . . then she bakes cookies . . . goes to spain . . . . she sulks  she stares . . . . the credits roll . uneven  full of holes  false starts  dead ends . we ff  d through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space . artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried . zzzz . . . . . . it  s like a beautifully shot chick  flick that  s pretending to be deep or artsy . you never get to know nor understand morvern at all . about halfway through you just don  t care anymore . we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop . don  t waste your time on this . i  m shocked it scores so high .  
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this     season  late may  and a good improvement on carrey  s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies . with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self  carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic  tearfully somber moments . elements of jim  s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie . this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons  including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script . while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy  drama  bruce  almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good  natured taste . eight out of ten stars .  
nothing happens .  br    br   then characters with no personality don  t develop .  br    br   then the end never comes because there  s no beginning and no middle .  br    br   there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren  t even allowed to be  because this movie isn  t even there . there  s no  is  in this movie because there  s no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point . there  s nothing   br    br   there is a good point it has a good soundtrack . but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn  t even worth your time  so if you  re really interested  i  d suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something . you  ll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue  headache  and impatience .  br    br     polarisdib  
ok  so it  s not a masterpiece like the godfather  but it doesn  t have to be . the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times . if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times  it has accomplished its purpose . i laughed out loud and left with a smile . i feel like i got my money  s worth .  
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning  and that ignorant fools like me don  t  get  it . obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross .  br    br   it has every  a  hem  artistic clich in the book  i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few . almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense .  br    br   the director of the  almost equally embarrassing  movie  ratcatcher  returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation . the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers .  
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc . carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time  and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting . the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast  including morgan freeman as  god   is great and makes the film worth catching . grade b  
it was probably just my dvd    but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd .  br    br   i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level  in order to hear about   percent of the dialog . some of the talking still remained sub  audible . if you  re from scotland  you might have a chance  albeit a slim one .  br    br   peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds  including unwrapping a package  footsteps  even puffing on a cigarette .  br    br   with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard  i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment  such as a disco . and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down .  br    br   there is art and there is art  even in the field of audio mixing . but this effort  in a time of war  would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity .  br    br   after about a half hour  i gave up  having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture  either .  
well not actually . this movie is very entertaining though . went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the  i think there might be something in my eye  routine . the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance . jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides . in fact all the characters are great . the movie is not overly funny or sappy  good flick to go see with the wife .  br    br   all in all     . . . . note  i am not an easy grader . thats all from bigv over and out   
when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible  the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with  or the point is one not easily conveyed to film  or the movie missed the point  which is the most frequent of these results  and the easiest to happen  especially when the point is one not easily defined . the book  morvern callar  has a point every reader of the book must have felt this  and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words . i  m not sure i can  myself  but perhaps it comes to this  or something like it things come  things go  such is life  but we carry on or at any rate some of us   people like morvern   do . no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition . but the important fact is that there is a point   possibly the sum of the entire story is the point   and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view  and to carry over  in adapting the story to film . the maker of this film evidently missed the point  and doesn  t substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing .  br    br   this is not the usual complaint of a book  lover that his favorite text has been violated . the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance  and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly . the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half  educated morvern  but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect  as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone  as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance  despite morvern  s own self  characterization as a raver  am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working  class scots girl  and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past  in any case  despite my irritation at the author  i couldn  t deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldn  t get out of my head was his character  s attitude  her angle on the world  which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait . morvern is the kind of person who  s always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her  like flies  so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging  through  unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical   and that doesn  t begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough . the complex of incidents and of morvern  s responses to them are the substance of the book  and its achievement  in exposing a cross  section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book  i can see this .  br    br   the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is  most of her is kept offscreen . an actress who might have been a good fit for the character  had she been the right age at the right time  is angharad rees  from the old tv series  poldark  . samantha morton  then  would seem like good casting she  s rather the same sort of actress  and in one of her earlier movies   jesus  son   she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one . unfortunately  as the film turned out  she doesn  t have the character from the book to play . for one thing  the book is one that  if it is to be dramatized  virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments  her perspective  her voice  the story loses most of its meaning . it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty  and so morvern  s responses  whether of amusement or distaste  depending on her mood  are missing too  and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story . in short  the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk  edgy serio  comic novel into a genteel art tv film  and chose as her typical image one of ms . morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross . this isn  t at all what the book  or the morvern of the book  was about . for another thing  the morvern of the movie isn  t scottish  the actress said in an interview she hadn  t had time to study up the accent   and she ought to be it  s important that she  her family  and her mates are all from a single place . and finally the film is missing the end of the story morvern  s spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it  s winter  the dam has frozen  the power has gone out  and the pub is dark . minus this  and minus all of the rest  what  s left is a failed art film  a dead film  about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal  or native inability  ever to give in to being dead .  
i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn  t the goal . his character is like all of us . wanting more  better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver .  br    br   morgan freeman made a great god . with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself .  br    br   i thought jennifer aniston  s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry  s basically self  centered tv anchorman wanna  be but that  s the way it was written .  br    br   i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened .  br    br   i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep . this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart .  br    br   a funny film .  
lynne ramsey makes arresting images  and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture . so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered  pretentious lark .  br    br   ramsey can  t bring callar to life . her attempts are too arty and oblique . repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton  s obliterated gaze alone could supply character . we are in a blank warholian hell of self  indulgence for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor  you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist . but how will it do so if she rarely speaks  without the novel  s interior monologue  the celluloid morvern callar is nobody . small wonder ramsey has morton undress often .  br    br   that said  the first ten minutes were so impressively acted  shot and edited that my hopes were soaring . give the film that much it knows how to make promises  if not how to keep any .  
i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies  especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side  and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie  but there are parts that are very serious  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi  function actor .  br    br   as for the rest of the cast  i was happy with jennifer aniston  s acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell  his limited scenes are very funny  especially in the anchor scene .  br    br   overall  i would have to rate this a  . good acting  funny script  and some very serious situations make this a very good film .  
i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen  besides the dead body in the first scenes . . . and her disposal of him . i was wrong . it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven . i really don  t care what young lassies from scotland do these days  who thy screw  what drugs they take . visually  the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me . the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend . as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts . . .  . that  s all there is   . now i see why her boyfriend killed himself . rename it .  bare bitch boredom  or what i did on my trip to spain .  i  m such a sucker for sticking these things out .  
i would have rated the series a perfect   for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season     br    br   the final episode of the   th season  unending   where  it would certainly appear that  the asgard have been killed  off in a very rushed  unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion  left me in disbelief   br    br   from the extremely rushed end of the series  it  s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season . my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg   franchise for the two upcoming direct  to  dvd moves   br    br   unless the asgard return in a future sg   movie  with a very good explanation of the  apparent  extinction   i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean  up of loose  ends   br    br   poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci  fi series .  
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show . i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is . but he goes on watching it none the less . that is his right as an american i guess . but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode . it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can  t stand . i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college . my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed  but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors . and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along  get the pun  ha  ha . like spielberg did . it  s like jesus before he became a man . or thats at least what i think that would feel like . any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this  even though it contains little of peter falk . i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet . this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo  s investigation  as many later episodes would do .  
i first heard about this film about   years ago when i was a kid in grade school     it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day  and under the entry for movies  or cinema  i don  t remember   were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental  and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon . it really intrigued me  since it stood out the most on the page  it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it  .  br    br   about   or so years later  the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole   dvd set of  treasures of american film archives  released by the national film preservation foundation . so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set  i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs . after all these years  i could finally see the film  after viewing it  it slightly wasn  t was i was expecting it to be  it tended to be a more organic  looking film  not that that  s a bad thing  but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic   but it was still an impressive film  imho  considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film  including hand  tinting the film itself  and using video equipment for some of the film  s scenes  filmed off of a video monitor   giving it a more distressed  lo  res look .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  the techniques used in this film were quite ground  breaking for     . that  s why it  s still one of my favorite short  experimental films  and a creative inspiration for me as well . . .  
my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke . little did we realize the joke was on her for paying   for it . while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles . these included  br    br     drinking bleach   rubbing sand in my eyes   writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy   re  enacting the american civil war   tax returns   gcse maths   sex with an old lady .  br    br   garrett clancy  aka sgt . ben draper wrote this  the guy couldn  t even dig a hole properly . the best ting he did was kick a door down  the best part of the film  . this was the worst film i have ever seen  and i  ve seen white noise the light . never has a film had so many mistakes in it . my girlfriend left it here  so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap .  br    br   news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself . fact .  br    br   do not watch  
a very funny movie . it was good to see jim carrey back in top form . it was definitely worth the price of admission . morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film . i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however  still a good film to see .  
i  m a fan of arty movies  but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel . agonisingly slow to develop a non  existent plot based on a promising premise  the experience is  shall we say  trying . even after bad movies i feel that i learn something  or enjoyed some aspect  but there there was nothing to appreciate . the premise was not uninteresting  but the movie starts and ends there . the acting was ok  though the characters were utterly boring . for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal  she is mightily empty . pity . i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic  but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .  
bruce almighty  one of carrey  s best pictures since . . . well . . . a long time . it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too . . . morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny . it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes . the best scene in  it is where jim is messing up the anchor man  s voice .  br    br   my rating      
it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person  not even as an extra . that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general .  however .  br    br   no spoilers  only a brief introductory description  br    br   buddy portrays four young people living in a flat  share in oslo . the protagonist are two young men that don  t manage to direct their life in any serious fashion  and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility  a sort of fear of growing up . the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models . quite the clich . although the story is mildly funny  the acting is good and as a  young person  one can sort of identify with the characters crazy  situations and complicated love affairs  i don  t find the story or the characters very believable . to polished and lacking in depth . this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as friends   yes that show on tv  .  br    br   has norwegian film finally found its identity   audience pleasers in well known american style .  br    br   how about watching lukas moodysson  s tillsammans  together  .  
this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made . carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film . he was both funny and sad . carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan . nolan blames god  morgan freeman  for everything that goes wrong in his life . then  god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers . as i said before  carrey did an excellent job . i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor  actress . the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point . this movie can be funny  bruce  s dog  as well as sad  the  break  up   . the script worked well  too . i am glad they made a sequel to this film . i rate this film a     .  
since  rugrats   falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years  obviously the tyrants at klasky  csupo should be out of ideas . after dumbing down all of the characters  adding even stupider new ones  replacing some voices  though i like nancy cartwright  she is not chucky finster    and having no sense of continuity  ex .  in a kimi episode i watched the other day  tommy and chucky each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode  the aforementioned dogs never appear   you  d think the creators could kill the show for mercy . but noooo .  br    br   all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks  while not as horrible as the kimi episodes  everyone is even stupider than they were  including grandpa  my god  he used to be the best character on the show  but now  he has no real purpose  . the ending is needlessly fluffy  and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes          is that the kids can interact with adults . whoa  what fun   br    br   no stars at all for  the rugrats all growed up  . klasky  csupo  please destroy this show before it gets any worse .  
bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan  an average man who feels god is messing up his life . god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways . of course  giving someone god  s powers could take a turn for the worse . bruce almighty is a good comedy  jim carrey is good  as always morgan freeman is first  rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well . the jokes are almost always on target  although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey  s facial expressions . i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god  not only that but also as a black man . i thought this quite well  especially with the brilliant freeman . there are some hilarious scenes  the opening cookie scene for instance  others miss the target slightly but still a good film .    out of    
comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene  when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case  when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant  but we weren  t to notice  and when colby was a fg triple agent . but now  in tonight  s episode  david is trapped with a paranoid  nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun  in an elevator and . . . . he can  t disarm him . a trained  experienced field agent who has been  st through the door many times and is experienced in hand  to  hand fighting  can  t take out a nut job . not when said nut job blinks  looks away  drops his head  closes his eyes not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for   seconds .  br    br   then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby  frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick  love interest amita  my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged . don gives david the  distress word  that is the code for  the st is about to go down   david is ready  they kill the lights  drop the elevator  startle the nut job and . . . . . .  br    br   david cannot disarm  kill  beat into submission the nut job . the bad guy ends up with both guns  david ends up shot .  br    br   i  m done . hope the numb  rs are fun .  
  bruce almighty  looks and sounds incredibly stupid  especially from the trailers . nevertheless  i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more . bruce  jim carrey  is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job . morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god  and though it isn  t his usual type of film or one of his best roles  he does excellent with what he is given to work with . although crude at times  the film does have quite a few laughs  from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers  reactions to him  as well as freeman  s seemingly laid  back and wisecracking image of god . it is overly exaggerated at times  and there is some crude humor  but overall it manages to be somewhat funny . there is a decent supporting cast  such as jennifer aniston  lisa ann walter  and steve carrell  which always helps . the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear  jerking  and the message is clear  that we should do what god has called us to do and  be the miracle .  the film is far from perfect  but still enjoyable  and far better than i and many people probably would have expected  especially if we see the deeper message of the film .  br    br    out of   
here  let me wave my hands over the keyboard  i  ll tell you what salad she  s going to order . over and over  works like a charm he  s such a genius  omg how does he do it  my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i  m scanning channels  i have to be very careful  these days it  s useful far too often  so i don  t need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this . . . careful with that remote   . is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery  or what  why does it exist    br    br   this is the most inane show  completely unbelievable and contrived  and i cannot understand why it  s still on the air . so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time  sarah connor chronicles  true blood   but give this nonsensical drivel a pass . shows like firefly  if there were any like that  fall away after a season  but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on . yeccch .  
if you want a serious laugh pain  watch this movie  and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster . the deleted scenes are priceless . i don  t know why they didn  t include them in the original movie . it can  t be because of time  since the movie is only    minutes long . morgan freeman is a brilliant actor  who has been overlooked for too long . jim carrey needs meds   
as an engineer  i must say this show  s first season started out very promising . most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible  and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge .  br    br   but after the first season  the show started degrading  heavily . most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science  technology for real .  br    br   the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode  but in the end  this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show .  br    br   if you are gonna watch it  go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . thereafter i would not waste my time . myself  i gave the show up midway through season  .  br    br   season    stars season    stars season    stars  br    br   let  s sum that up to  stars . since charlie doesn  t know his math anymore  i won  t bother with the correctness of mine either .  
as someone who lives near buffalo  new york  this movie scored points with me before i even saw it  since the story is based here . there are even some bit parts with real  life news  tv anchor people from buffalo . . and  for once  it doesn  t knock the area . hallelujah   br    br   theology  wise  puh  leeze    god is still made to look and think like humans . . . and  of course  be a bit on the liberal side . being the lightweight comedy it is  it  s nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill    minutes .  br    br   there are some laugh  out  loud slapstick comedy scenes and  hopefully  audiences  from christians to atheists .  got something out of this besides a few laughs  such as what prayer should really be all about . kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message .  br    br   overall  it  s a good  hearted film that should offend very few .  
after watching a dozen episodes  i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling . in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models  i thought that my profession was being joked about . i am not a mathematician  instead a chemical engineer  but i do work a lot with mathematical models . so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to  make  believe  of fairy tales .  br    br   first  choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task . charlie eppes is shown as a genius  but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model  specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future . individuals are erratic and haphazard  there is no modeling for them . isaac asimov even wrote about that in the      s . even if there were a model for specific kind of individual  it would be a probabilistic  stoichastic  one  meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction .  br    br   second  supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found  the model parameters have to be known . these parameters are the constants of the equations  such as the gravity acceleration   .  m  s    and often are not easy to determine . again  charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses . and after the model and the parameters are chosen  they would have to be tested . oddly  they are not  and by miracle  they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted .  br    br   third  a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected  not only by numbers  but also by sci  fi movies the computational effort required for solving these models . try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job . even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models  he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow . and even with the right software  hardware combination  the model solution might well take days to be reached . he solves them immediately  i could use his computer in my research work  i would be very glad .  br    br   as a drama  it is far from being the best show . the characters are somewhat stereotyped  but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are . the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent .  br    br   for some layman  the show might work . for others  the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow   
i really do not know what people have against this film  but it  s definitely one of my favourites . it  s not preachy  it  s not anchored by it  s moral  it shouldn  t be controversial . it  s just god . any possible god  no matter the religion . and it  s really funny .  br    br   jim carry plays bruce nolan  a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news  desperate to prove himself  more or less to himself  that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job . this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace  jennifer aniston  away . when the final straws are executed  he  s quick to not laugh  but yell in the face of god  who in turn gives bruce his powers . bruce then makes his life better for himself  until he  s guilted into helping others  where he then continues to miss the point of his powers . meanwhile  his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish  leaving his relationship on dangerous ground .  br    br   ok  that was kinda long . but as a plot  it works well . the step  by  step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together  and is able to hide itself fairly well .  br    br   as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place  carrey  s pitch  perfect acting stays in character  which  luckily enough  is him   and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene . whether they would admit it or not  the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey . without him  the humour would turn flat  as humour is half execution . and the humour is very good in the first place . but without carrey  it would kinda feel like a it  s a wonderful life wannabe .  br    br   jennifer aniston is great and  no matter what some may say  does not act like the only excuse for the third act . at least  you don  t think that when you see her . she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you  re watching a movie  she and carrey feel very much like a real couple .  br    br   the movie feels ggooooodd  see the movie to understand   has a very nice feeling  tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey  s career  which wasn  t goin  anywhere .  .  
the  math  aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows . the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow  although his career must have been  undeservedly  waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock .  br    br   the lame  ness of the  math  aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co  starring lou diamond phillips  which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned .  in order to catch a fugitive  the  mathematician  uses some theory about  bubbles  . so  he gives this long explanation that  if we have seen the suspect in places a  b and c  then we can use  bubble theory  to calculate where he might be . he does this all on a chalkboard  or maybe with a stick in the dirt  i cant remember  .  br    br   anyway  when you look at the finished product  he basically took three spots  and picked a point right in the middle and said  ok  mathematically  here  s where we are most likely to find the fugitive .  at which point  one other character points out  oh  that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live .  is that math  its not even connect  the  fkg  dots    this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to  support  points that every one else had already agreed on through either less  complex analysis or basic common sense .  br    br   it just goes to show   when you  re a hammer  everything looks like a nail . i can  t wait til they stick the numb  rs team on osama . . . they  ll use calculus  call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains  and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields . . . cuz hey . . . its all about the numbers .  br    br   totally ludicrous tv show .  
well  was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns  this film sure was better than that bore   oh  god  . i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through . carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe  and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance . i  for one  don  t consider her to be either ugly or untalented . i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history . see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one . well written and even better played out  this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman  s best .  
this is really really bad . lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job . but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric  i got the evidence on you   .  makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics  attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn  t find it on itunes  . talk about seeing into the future . . . too funny for words . the rest of the movie is forgettable . the score and songs are more interesting than the script . ditto the sequel . which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all . my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies . doesn  t say much for the world  s viewing habits .  
now either you like mr carrey  s humour or you don  t . me  myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and  on the other hand  cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream  but you have been warned .  br    br   if you  re not sure  watch the trailer . i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film . if you don  t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny  don  t bother with the movie .  br    br   carrey  a reporter stuck in a rut covering  lighter news  berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better . carrey gets into the swing of having all of god  s powers by making his girlfriend  jennifer aniston   s breasts bigger  getting himself promoted  and answering everyone  s prayers by single stroke computer commands .  br    br   this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable  but it is very well made within it  s very limited intent  provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans  and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow  minded god  squadders and anti  god  squadders .  br    br   on the more thoughtful level  the film tempts us to speculate about carrey  s own career  stuck in his  comedy  typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes . his most accomplished  straight  role  the man on the moon  is less well known that his comedy romps  or the truman show  on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey  .  
  cia codenamealexa  is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson  s classic film  la femme nikita        . the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them .  pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita  the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o . j . simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history . lamas   acting  is simply a bad steven segal impersonation . watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience .  br    br   the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable . there are so many action movie  conventions  in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions  people flying thru glass windows  terrorists  bad ponytails  etc . the musical score resembles david michael frank  s score for  hard to kill         which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie . there is plenty of martial arts in the film  and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production . the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up  and i have to admit i was mildly entertained .  br    br   lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early    s but he is certainly no action star  that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters . my recommendation is that you skip  cia codenamealexa  and check out  la femme nikita  instead .  
i nominate this and babylon  as the best television sci  fi series made . both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . if you look at the original star trek and star trektng  they were fine shows  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . in many ways  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . this was less the case with deep space   with its giant battles that took up all of the final season  and the other trek shows  as there was more of a larger story that unified them . this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon  and saw this to an even greater extent with sg   . the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . sure  there were a few  throwaway  episodes that were not connected to the rest  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny .  br    br   and speaking of funny  i loved that sg   kept the mood light from time to time and wasn  t so dreadfully serious . in this way  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon  . jack o  neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson   it  s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons .  br    br   to truly appreciate sg    you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . and  if you don  t like sg   after giving it a fair chance  then sci  fi is probably not the genre for you .  
i don  t understand how   of us  receive such a high rating . . . i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense  followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble . however  i did like jared harris  performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted  hours .  
starring jim carrey  morgan freeman  jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie . i mean  what a conceptual nightmare . jim carrey playing god  nothing is sacred anymore .  br    br   well  this movie is hardly sacred  but it also is not sacrilegious  at least not to any great extent . yes  jim carrey has the powers of god for a while  but he is not god . confused  i  ll give you the low down .  br    br   jim carrey plays bruce nolan  a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life . he lives with his beautiful girlfriend  grace  anniston   and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other  but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground .  br    br   then bruce gets a shot at anchorman  only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter . obviously not please  bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired .  br    br   much complaining and griping about god later  bruce gets a page . after a while he gets tired of it calling  so he responds and goes to the omni presents building  heh  . there he meets god  freeman   who is the boss  electrician  and janitor of the building . i found this highly amusing . god is the boss  the holy spirit is the electrician  and jesus christ is the janitor . think about it . boss  obvious . electrician  the guy who keeps everything running . janitor  the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left . brilliant .  br    br   anyway  bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god  but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god  he starts to believe a bit . wonder why . enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies .  br    br   since this is hollywood  bruce obviously eventually smartens up  learns his lesson  and starts using his powers for the good of the world . in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done  not bruce  s .  br    br   since it is jim carrey  the movie is quite amusing  and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it . the movie is not perfect theology  but for hollywood  it is definitely a good attempt . many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging  and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie .  br    br   so  while far from perfect  definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it .  br    br   bottom line  .  out of   worth a view or two   
lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent  who captures some exotic beauty named alexa  kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers . o . j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble . i must admit i  m not a fan of lorenzo lamas  or his movies . he stinks . however when compared to o . j simpson and lamas  comatose wife kinmont  lamas seems like ah  jean  claude van damme . i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o . j simpson trial  you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels  you couldn  t escape this movie . in     you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv . the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o . j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor . also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic   br    br    out of    bad   
jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  and of course they have to be mexican  obviously   his good will towards his fellow man backfires . in that case  it wasn  t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn  t be ignored . i  m reminded of the episode of michael moore  s brilliant the awful truth  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . the results were not very promising  so it  s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example .  br    br   jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . or even better  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film  . bruce is nearly   years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that  s seeking to bake the world  s biggest cookie . he  s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . needless to say  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film .  br    br   morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman  s massive talent as an actor . he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously  but in such a way as to advise his followers  as well as the viewers of this movie  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . there are a lot of people in the world  maybe more than our share in america  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans .  br    br   one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer  s religion . i  for example  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . but despite the fact that i don  t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie .  br    br   jim carrey  s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he  s come . if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  both of which i loved  by the way  or a lot of what he did before he got into film  it  s amazing how far he  s come . he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show  man on the moon  and the majestic  easily one of his greatest films ever  . jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today .  br    br   jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  as she did in the side  splitting office space  as bruce  s girlfriend  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce  s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . there is definitely some low  brow comedy in the film that doesn  t really fit with the importance of the film  s meaning or the quality of the delivery  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura  s friend spike make a cameo appearance . as stephen king very well knows  it  s always nice to see familiar characters . it  s almost like seeing family again .  br    br   bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . the thing i love about this is that  like i said before  religion is absent from my life  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers . the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way  which empowers the message even more .  br    br   the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position  the jimmy hoffa scene  who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records   the scene where bruce  s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera  and my favorites  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery  s cooking . the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes  such as when he says to god  who reveals that he  s the janitor  the proprietor  the electrician  etc  that his christmas parties must be real bashes  and to be careful about drinking  because on of him might need a ride home  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . a little too true  and as gallagher would add  behind every great man is also an amazed mother  in  law .  br    br   bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection . it is a comedy written and performed in good taste  but with enough relatively low  brow humor to keep the kids entertained . this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy   it  s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . don  t miss this one .  
spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie  lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy  pretty boy act  and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa . oj simpson is a detective  coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona . translation cable tv filler . there isn  t enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure .  br    br   the script has some gaping holes . best  worst moment in one jarring scene  oj  s partner expresses his aversion to the morgue . oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot  or words to that effect . this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released  it is truly appalling  and therefore entertaining in an unintentional  horrible way . i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose . now that  s a guilty pleasure . bc  
as long as you go into this movie knowing that it  s terrible bad acting  bad  effects   bad story  bad . . . everything  then you  ll love it . this is one of my favorite  goof on  movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs   
as an impressionable   year old  i liked the  love conquers all  philosophy of the   s sitcom  bridget loves bernie .  i did understand the controversy  which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver  david birney  and an irish catholic school teacher  meredith baxter  and both sets of parents  harold j . stone and bibi osterwald as bernie  s parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget  s parents  who have issues with the young couple  s interfaith marriage .  br    br   looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences  i am amazed that the show was even a success for one  albeit  highly  rated season . created by veteran tv writer bernard slade  who a few years after the show  s cancellation would write the successful play  same time  next year    bridget loves bernie  was a very light  superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight .  br    br   there was no denying the real  life chemistry between birney and baxter . but  in later years  both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects  birney in his short  lived role in  st . elsewhere  and baxter in  family  and  family ties   . here  they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge  which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject .  br    br   the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses  all in the family  and  mary tyler moore  . both of those shows were smart  funny and had enough of an edge  more so on the former that the latter  that kept my interest in the situation and the characters .  bridget loves bernie  was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles .  br    br   this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered .  
china o  brien       was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states . this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse . sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he  s lost his touch because he  s not that great of a director . the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms . rothrock and richard norton . if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight  to  video action flick .  br    br   china o  brien returns home to help out her dad . he  s having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help . so she returns home and restores order  with the help of two unlikely people  . but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies   br    br   if you  re a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie  s catered for you . i only enjoyed the fighting scenes  everything else is rubbish . why didn  t raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director   br    br   recommended .  
this film was hard to get a hold of  and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming . i mean  this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt . with all of this built  in interest  how could anyone make such a lackluster  talk  laden flick of this true  life event . while williams is always interesting  the screenwriters assumed that the d . b . cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star  s what we get is a type  without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off . harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty  but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction . shame on this film for even existing .  
this one and  her pilgrim soul  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone . as i mentioned in my comment on the new series  there  s something lacking in this new series . maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . it  s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling  s version . however  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . i think the appeal is that no matter what they do  the lovers can never unite . i remember i wasn  t surprised by the korean movie  il mare   later remade into  the lake house  . i think it  s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .  
as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true  life tale  i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been .  br    br   the bad  i  m a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played  but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator .  br    br   the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage  mouth . from what i read  there were several directors replacing each other on this film  and that  s too bad . you can tell things aren  t right with the story . i couldn  t get  involved  with treat williams  portrayal of cooper  either . he should have been fascinating  but he wasn  t in this movie . it  s also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of  folk hero   but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy  too .  br    br   not everything was disappointing . i can  t complain about the scenery  from the lush  green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona .  br    br   i  d like to see this movie re  made and done better  because it is a one  of  a  kind story .  
this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories  i note both of them are based on short stories  .  examination day  is set in the future  year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves  huge tv  looking  phones  that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age . . . and the examination day  a point where    year  olds must undergo a government  required iq test . the kid is this story  dickie jordan  david mendenhall  is just celebrating his own   th birthday and is a smart kid  so is calm  even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . his parents  christopher allport and elizabeth norment   on the other hand  say he shouldn  t have used his birthday wish on getting a good score  and while their reason includes that they believe he  s capable and he should have no need to worry  it  s pretty obvious they are worried . i won  t give anything away in the ending  but i will say this  there  s a point where we get a glimpse of what  s to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening  or another   his parents ask dickie whether he  d prefer to watch tv all night . by today  s standards  we  d be pleased he  d say he  d rather read and not just because there  s nothing worth watching . . . but why would his family ask this  the flavor of what  s encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon  which i hear hasn  t received a great adaptation to the screen  . i only wish they could  ve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was . i found it to be better than the short story it was based on . i haven  t read the one that  a message from charity  was based on  but would like to since it was interesting  a    year  ld boy  peter  robert duncan mcneill  is suffering a fever from unclean water  that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown . . . but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever  charity payne   kerry noonann  who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . they both recover  especially since it  s common for that to happen in      but the connection doesn  t go away . charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of     and they each enjoy each other  s company  especially peter  who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students  even at the college he  s been staying in one place at . things take an unexpected turn  though  when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the   colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment  added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever  not so common in      . the two try to learn a way to save her . the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times  through a lesson  warning that sounds like something rod sterling would  ve cooked up and entertainment  make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship  love  and wisdom do a great deal . probably    of this has no theme  but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling  s crew .  
i can  t believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny . shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty  disgust and stupidity   there  s something about mary  leaves little reason to stay until the end . sure  cameron diaz is very pretty  but that is never going to be enough to save a movie . ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot  and is obviously very talented  but the movie is a loser .  br    br   not once were any of the scenes believable . the shots were badly timed and poorly framed . the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs . i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid .  br    br        the bonus is from the one time i smiled . it  s not like i  m immune to humor or alone in my opinion . my wife hated it  too . the next day we saw  rush hour  and laughed ourselves silly . this movie just stunk .  
remember these two stories fondly and in the first  set in the not too distant future  we see a young boy preparing for examination day  the state i . q test . the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test . upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why . the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth . the boy then asks  puzzled again  why wouldn  t he  it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry  but their son  s i . q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial . a corker of a concluding scene  a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present . which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present . a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion .  
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite . i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn  t mean it is a terrorist thing . it also show  s how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype  by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn  t mean we are all bad we just try to live  day at a time  like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like  blow up  or yaser saying we  ll blow away the competition  and people took it the wrong way . being a muslim i know that stuff like this don  t usually happen  but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq  its not right things are not like that . people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act . i am glad a show like this came on the air . there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists  many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair  but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name .  
you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies  even the really bad ones  why  to see their heroes in action one more time . that  s the way i feel about doc savage . i am a major fanatic for the character  and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming . and the first   minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation . then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie  resulting in a somewhat disjointed film . there  s a lot of promise in here  diluted by a number of unfortunate choices  the music  the  camp  elements  etc .  but the spirit of doc is there  and that  s what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to . so  in my long  winded way  what i  m trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it  s just not as good as it should have been . and anyone who is a fan of superman  james bond  indiana jones  buckaroo banzai  and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all .  
up until this new season i have been a big  little mosque  fan . however  the new season had absolutely ruined it .  br    br   the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show . it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice . the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light .  br    br   i am neither christian or muslim  but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend . not any more .  br    br   just cancel it and be done with it . it  s not worth watching any more .  br    br   it might still be saved  but a lot of change would need to be made .  br    br   bring back the old format .  
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression . it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace . a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball .  br    br   likewise  an occasional excursion of  or  hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema . the presence of a radio in just about everyone  s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world  s events and provided many a drama and  especially  comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality .  br    br   the literature of the time also flourished at all levels . the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it  what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures . but the comic book just did not magically appear  all fully developed with all the colorful  color pages  all by itself . there were mediums that were ancestral to them . obviously  the newspaper comic strip was one parent  providing the visual  narrative method of story telling .  br    br   the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine . the inexpensive  prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going  though not necessarily serialized  tales . the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough  s tarzan and johnston mcculley  s zorro . the      s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow  the avenger  g   s battle aces and the spider  master of men all found their way to the news stands  among many others .  br    br   one other was doc savage  a full  blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps  the only  picture  of the hero . possessing extraordinary strength  super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect  doc was the prototype super hero .  br    br   he also assembled  of his former army buddies into a small  free lancing team of adventurers . each of them was an expert in a given field . so we had a top rated chemist  lawyer  construction engineer  electrical engineer  geologist  archaeologist  paleontologist  etc .  br    br   the doc savage stories were very popular in the      s and     s  and were published into the middle     s . then they went into a hiatus for a good      years . then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new  container   the paperback book . a fresh look to the cover art was introduced  featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc  with a perpetually ripped shirt .  br    br   the re  introduction proved to be highly successful  with the publication of a title a month  and for a while more  . soon  there was a rumor of a doc savage movie  but when  by what producer  well  the venerable  man of bronze  was back on the news stands for over   years before any real project got put together . it was veteran stop  action animator and producer of top special effects films  geoprge pal  who did the film along with warner brothers .  br    br   when doc savage  man of bronze arrived in the movie houses  it boasted of a well casted team of actors  albeit a largely  no name  as far familiarity with the viewers . with former tarzan of tv  ron ely  s nearly perfect casting in the lead  up and coming beauty of a starlette  pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler  as the villainous  captain seas   no other name would have been recognized . and  just maybe that was a plus in this case .  br    br   the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going . use of narration  by paul frees  and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story .  br    br   from the very start  there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured  camp  humor as the batman tv series . some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected  unlikely outcomes .  for example  an experiment of doc  s with a miniature rocket  missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish  a small one at that .  the whole story unfolds like that  hitting the viewer with a little  camp  every so often  as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously . we are also puzzled about mr . george pal  s being the producer  his last  . he who had been so well known for special effects  surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci  fi action setting of the pulp character  s world .  br    br   i can remember seeing it quite vividly . mrs . ryan  deanna  was in the hospital  just having given birth to our  nd child  michelle           . our older girl  jennifer  was visiting her grandmother  so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward  it was straight over to the old marquette theatre    rd  kedzie  here in chicago .  br    br   having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc  i was sort of let down by the final product . i could accept a little of this  camp  business  but would not have objected if mr . pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp  comic  serial type excitement .  br    br   and yet  the cast  headed  up by mr . ely and the others  made the whole film likable  if not lovable . the sets and locations were  as far as we can see  very much like those of a     s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone .  br    br   and maybe that  s just what they were trying for with this doc savage  man of bronze .  
who likes awful  comedy  shows like little mosque on the prairie  the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one  muslims and self  proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn  t even matter if the show is good or funny at all  which it is not  . two  old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable  badly written  stale jokes .  br    br   cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is . if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen  their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left . i  d be curious who even writes for this show  do you think it  s actually muslims  or hip  funny young people  no  i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the      s .  br    br   when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are  air farce was only finally just taken off the air  thank goodness   but we still have lame ducks like this hour has   minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for  not to mention this poor excuse for  comedy  little mosque on the prairie . it is supposed to be offencive and funny  only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny . shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching .  
having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based . upon this point i cannot comment  having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously . however  what i can say with certainty  is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let  s be honest here  this film is just so much fun   br    br   ok . . so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character  s but let  s put this into a clear perspective . . do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic      s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character  or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the     film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series   br    br   the point is  yes this film is incredibly camp but that  s precisely its charm   br    br   former tarzan  ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this  and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot   and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles . also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman .  br    br   best scene  far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke  lemonade and milk at a formal occasion  also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen   priceless   br    br   simply put  the film doesn  t take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it . great fun from start to finish   and you  ll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed    
unlike many  i don  t find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive . its execution  however  is another matter entirely . like so many b  minus movies  all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers . for most of the    or  so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor . or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers . with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over  emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late  night infomercial  but not a primetime sitcom  even a canadian one .  notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle  i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas . unfortunately  they got the tone   and the script   completely wrong for the prairies . the final insult is that they apparently couldn  t even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town  why  are they so hard to find in saskatchewan   did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors  as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon  and that the rest of the world  primed by the cbc  s publicists  quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom .  
this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate . it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention . such as  how was the stargate activated without a human computer  where did the goa  uld  ra  s race  come from  how many are there   br    br   the first episode has a retired jack o  neill  spelled with  ls  recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis  a powerful goa  uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman . we meet samantha carter  a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time  and is determined to go through now . we find out that daniel got married on abydos  and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial . then daniel  s wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen .  br    br   it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams  in which jack  s team will be sg   which consists of jack  samantha and daniel . they go to chulak  a goa  uld homeworld to rescue daniel  s wife and another one captured at abydos named ska  ra . they get captured  and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners  a jaffa named teal  c  first prime of apophis  saves them and goes to earth with them  where he is made part of sg   .  br    br   that was only the beginning of the adventure . in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future  gotten transported to alternate realities  swapped bodies  grown old  met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa  uld called the tok  ra  in which samantha  s dad becomes a member  the asgard  a cute little race in which we see thor most often  he  s jack  s buddy   and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times .  br    br   the show was recently canceled  but lasted ten seasons . in season nine  a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers  new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators  the ancients . season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters  ben browder as cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg   and claudia black as vala maldoran  a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team .  br    br   very well  produced  interesting characters  fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack  this one has it all . a different way of travelling the galaxy  and different kinds of adventures  this is one show you don  t want to miss . unlock the gate and step through . you won  t regret it   
this movie is one long chiche after another . first of all  though they did their share  there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot . the wigs and accents are terrible . they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons . john is the nasty  envious  closet homosexual  slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book . they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation  it was always just the two of us   john would not have been mean to his fans like this either . like his death showed us he was too nice if anything . the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul  s yesterday . an insulted john says something along the lines of  sure and while i croon why don  t you get down on your knees  put on your wife  s wig  and lick my liggin  . that made me laugh for days . really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous . john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day  they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here . forget it .  
possible spoilers  br    br   i recently watched this movie with my   year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences . ron ely is just right as doc . cool  calm  almost always in control  and with an occasional twinkle in his eye  . what more can one ask for  i have never read a doc savage book  so i don  t know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring  do . many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark  which i don  t think is fair . the difference in budget is astounding  raiders must have at least   times the budget  . doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has . special effects are also at a minimum but come on people  the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right . the sousa music is catchy  love that theme song  every time i watch the film  i end up humming the theme for days  . the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy . highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas . not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib  really   . overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day . i give it  out of   .  br    br   doc savage  doc savage . . . thank the lord he  s here   
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show  given all the hype and the clever preview clips . and talk about hype  i even heard an interview with the show  s creator on the bbc world today  a show that is broadcast all over the world .  br    br   unfortunately  this show doesn  t even come close to delivering . all of the jokes are obvious  the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame  and they are not given any new treatment or twist . all of the characters are one  dimensional . the acting is  well  mediocre  i  m being nice  . it  s the classic cbc recipe  one that always fails .  br    br   if you  re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters  and if you  re white you  d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted  ignorant  or both . not that making fun of white people is a problem  most of the better comedies are rooted in that . it  s only a problem when it isn  t funny  as in this show .  br    br   canada is bursting with funny people  so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis . so how come the producers of this show couldn  t find any   
most people miss hollywood  s point of concept . if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child  within the confines of the law then i  approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage .  br    br   in all times of conflict or war  the public and government look for heroes to decorate . the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with  such as doc savage  james bond  superman  batman  spiderman and others . doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the  best of the best  before james bond  superman or any of the others . all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character  not the  man of bronze  .  
this show is terrible  the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse . i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two  all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them . well at least corner gas was good at first  little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode  . who are the people who are watching this show anyway  i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies  maybe the jokes are for them and they work there  i don  t know a single person who likes this show and can  t stand it myself  the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas . hopefully it won  t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could  should have led to a great show .  
the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the    s  created concept that comic books could only be done as  camp   i . e .  the    s batman show  for tv and movie . thus you have combat sequences with subtitles  come on    a cluelessly unromantic doc savage  he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps  not an idiot   monk mayfair in a nightsheet  a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights   and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute . and when they  re not doing booming sousa march scores  the tinkly little  funny  music undercuts much of the drama .  br    br   even as such  this movie is . . . okay . it  s fun  and when it stays serious it  s a very accurate representation of the pulps . except for monk  as has been mentioned before he  s hugely muscled  not obese . and long tom  who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude  not paul gleason with an  inexplicable  scarf .  br    br   the green death sequences  for instance  are remarkably gruesome and not something i  d recommend for children . but they are very close to the feel of the pulps . when the writers and producers get it right  they do get it right  i  ll give them that .  br    br   but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of  say  reeves  first two superman movies  think what we might have had then . i think the problem is the movie  s schizophrenic . there  s a definite sense of trying to do a    s homage  but they  re also trying to give in to the  heroes must be camp  attitude that batman created . one gets the impression there was a sober  pulp  style first draft and then someone came in and said   hey  let  s make it funny  it worked with the batman show  years ago    br    br   but doc lives on  thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai . if macrauch ain  t doing a homage to doc savage in that movie  the man is truly demented . so when the series actually gets on tv  allegedly mid  season in         doc savage  updated to the    s  will live once more .  
if you  re looking to be either offended or amused or both  you  ll probably have to look elsewhere . lmotp really isn  t even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichs . at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess .  br    br   beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it  s just another lame  innocuous and anti  septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing . and once the  zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao    hype wears out its welcome  the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it  s so shallow when judged on its merits alone .  br    br   unless you  re obsessed with muslim culture in the west and  or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don  t see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype . other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural  ethnic dichotomy in western multi  ethnic societies . lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight .  
this is a very entertaining movie . a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who  apparently  think that the film was an effort at serious drama . it was not made that way . . . . it is an extremely enjoyable film  performed in a tongue in cheek manner . all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us . the fight sequences are lively  brisk and  above all  not gratuitous . the so  called  green death   utilized on a couple of occasions  is not  as i read in one review   gruesome  . a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film . hey  lighten up . . . again  i remind one and all that this is a fun film . each phase of this  fight  was captioned  which added to the fun aspect . the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan . this is not one of those martial arts films . ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc . another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the  bad guy   seas  is dealt with . i promise you that if you don  t try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value  you will spend    minutes in a most enjoyable manner .  
i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all . the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it  s getting talked about  i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason  they are usually true . but there really wasn  t anything funny about these stereotypical characters . the  fresh of the boat  dad  who doesn  t understand his daughter . the radical feminist muslim daughter  who by the way is a terrible actress   and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can  he  s a pretty good actor  i only see him getting better  .  br    br   it is very contrived and the dialog doesn  t flow that well . there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed  and don  t really care to watch another episode .  br    br   i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again  she  s always a treat and a natural at everything she does  too bad her daughter in the show doesn  t have the same acting abilities   
outragously entertaining period piece set in the   s  it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series  as much as  raiders of the lost ark   only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson . the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau  predating batman by two decades . starring ron ely  tarzan  as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non  existent latin american country of hidalgo . best line  our hero to mona  holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug  mona  you  re a brick    br    br   paul wexler  s ham  and  cheese blackhat  captain seas is a an absolute delight . expect a little  raiders . .   a dash of  batman   a little  the lost world   a little  lost horizons  and a whole lot of campiness and you  ll get it just right . watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa  s patriotic music . a prime candidate for dvd release  it is certainly overdue . an unmissable treat for the whole family .      
little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen . they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most  easily  offended viewers which for cbc means   year old farmers in saskatchewan . the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can  t believe it . the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don  t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded . very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as  controversial  well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has   minutes  royal canadian air farce and rick mercer  s report .  
i was brought up on doc savage  and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now  i found it thoroughly entertaining . i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions  granted they mostly think i  m odd but there you are .  i don  t know what it is about the doc  but he always gets the girls  has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men . this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre  and was way before it  s time  it is not to be taken seriously  move over austin powers . ron ely is a god . it is unfortunate that this film hasn  t been released on dvd in the uk . i don  t think it should be remade and bastardised  like i said it  s a classic  it cannot be done without ron .  like the italian job without mini  s and michael caine  . i give it      .  
this series just gets worse and worse . poorly written and just plain not funny  the premise is excellent  but the writer  s inexperience shines through . by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about  and resorted to that patronizing  smug   oh  silly you  style acting that comes with a no laugh script . they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say  aren  t we zany  isn  t this funny  well  no  it  s not actually . gum disease is less painful . no wonder  with the exception of corner gas  canadians generally avoid canadian tv . come on cbc you  re suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent . pull the plug on this amateurish mess .  
we so often talk of cinema landmarks  kane  the godfather  a bout de souffle . one film however is too often overlooked by  serious  film critics . i am talking of course about the classic doc savage  m . o . b .   br    br   this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism . not to mention kung  fu .  br    br   it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history  until of course queen  s breathtaking work on flash gordon  . although a bit of a rarity  this film is well worth seeking out  it will repay the effort of your search ten  fold .  
once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode .  br    br   last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter . how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists  ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses . but not   minutes . it  s called beating a dead horse . even snl would know to give up after a commercial break .  br    br   also  let  s have a little conflict in these scripts . will she or won  t she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan  when will ramadan start  ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here .  br    br   and the characters  what characters   they are all cardboard cut  outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next . that  s the point of the situation comedy . we need to have strong  interesting  dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week . we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they  re going to get into next week . if i never see these characters it  ll be too soon . thankfully i can  t remember any of their names  note to cbc  that  s not a good sign  .  br    br   and the acting is so bland . it  s more so a problem in casting than in the actors . none of these people actually embody the characters they play . they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week . sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character  make us fall in love with them  where they become inseparable from the character the portray . watch any american sitcom and you  ll see how easily identifiable characters are . part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next  years portraying . that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows . but to be honest  considering the lame concept and the horrible writing  there  s not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture . as another commenter mentions  this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom .  br    br   and the directing or lack there of  what can i say  canada has so much talent  look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up . look at the trailer park boys  not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog  . look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that  s where many of our stars go to find decent work .  br    br   give credit to the cbc  they really know how to build publicity for a non  event . remember  the one   no  well don  t even try to learn any characters names in this show  as it  s sure to go the way of the dodo .  br    br   let  s all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while .  
given the title  this first follow  up to quartet       obviously reduces the number of w . somerset maugham stories which comprise the film . the author still turns up to introduce the episodes  but there  s no epilogue this time around by the way  while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r . c . sheriff  here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation  as well as noel langley  though it  s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison  . as can be expected  much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment  though this also extends to at least three cast members  namely naunton wayne  wilfrid hyde  white and felix aylmer  the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled the colonel  s lady  . while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor  slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running  time   it  s still done with the utmost care  acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain .  br    br   the verger tells of a church sexton  james hayter   for which the story  s title is another word  who  s dismissed after   years of service by the new parish priest  michael hordern  simply because he  s illiterate . rather than rest on his laurels  despite his age  he not only takes a wife  his landlady  played by kathleen harrison  but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered  and  with business flourishing  this is developed into a whole chain . the last scene  then  sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who  not only is surprised to learn of hayter  s lack of education  but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were  to which the wealthy  and respected  tobacconist replies  with some measure of irony  that he had the calling to be a verger   br    br   the second episode  mr . know  all  is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man  nigel patrick   british despite his foreign  sounding name of kelada  who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun . naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde  white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most  the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick  s attentions to his pretty wife  anne crawford  . during a fancy  dress party  however  the passengers decide to enact their revenge  on kelada by having one of them impersonate him  a jest which he naturally doesn  t appreciate    still  it  s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character  told by crawford that the necklace she  s wearing is an imitation  wayne challenges patrick to name its pricebut the latter realizes immediately that it  s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford  s position if he were to tell  so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer   br    br   as can also be deduced from the title  sanatorium deals with the myriad patients at such a place  run by andre  morell the protagonist is a new intern  roland culver  who wistfully observes the various goings  on . the narrative  in fact  highlights in particular three separate strands of plot  one humorous  the feud  between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium  played by finlay currie and john laurie   one melodramatic  the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long  suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies  and one bittersweet  the romance between nave but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which  in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a lifer  while rennie only has a few years left to him  leads the couple to the altar  .  
this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news  sports  or satirical sketch comedy . as a developer of situation comedy  cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of  king of kensington  with the belly laughs of  the beachcombers  . it is an embarrassment to great shows like  kids in the hall  and  second city  that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production .  br    br   i have to admit  that i didn  t give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept . to start  half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip  off one of the few sitcom successes in english  canadian history   corner gas  . the rest of the concept   the cultural clash   is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness . the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the  fish out of water  characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be  edgy  and  topical   but comes off as forced . some of the jokes that are based around the local  s reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved  especially the audience .  br    br   this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn  t  get it  when it comes to creating canadian content  especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment . cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy  handed and forced way . it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity . i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle . a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas   i . e . the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines . more realistically  their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics .  br    br   that being said  even as a formulaic fish  out  of  water comedy this show fails . the acting is weak  the comic pacing all over the map  and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief  even for a comedy . the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath  who is horribly wasted here . i doubt that even the addition of guest stars  colin mochrie  for example  as an anglican archbishop  can save this dog . i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc  s  hype  had died down but two episodes were all i could stand   i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline . the time  slot would be better served by airing more coronation street  air farce re  runs  or dr . who . even an infomercial would be an improvement .  
the makers have chosen the best people for the job  and set the scene wonderfully . every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it . whether the period is the   s  the first story   the present  ie      for the middle story  or the     s  the last   costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created . i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium  exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls . roland culver as ashenden is very appealing  but never mind the soppy young lovers  it  s raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife  s health and independence who harrows our emotions . he usually played comical  pompous types  but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive . the china seas  great   s film starring gable and harlow  stole the plot from the mr know all episode  and also nicked a story by kipling  . i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband  though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat . i love that posh bird who plays his wife  too .  
i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with . but the execution was poor . the script is poor and acting is bad . there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way  like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard . the show can  t be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably . i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent .  br    br   till now second season is worse than the first one . i had my hopes high regarding this show  but i was kind of disappointed . still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers . anyway i wish best of luck for the future .  
trio  s vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable . it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young . the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch .  br    br   observation . in film it isn  t necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile .  small morality  storytelling is quaint  or coy  only in the eye of the beholder   thankfully . story content   well told   can overcome it  s time  subject or place .  br    br   ironically  there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era . inserting  small morality  content   occasionally   might provide a dimension lacking .  
i  m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel .  i  m thinking matrix  i  m thinking bladerunner  i  m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel  wearing shiny black leather  or some chick just like her  leave that one with us . only  get this   we  ll do it without any plot  dialogue  character  decent action or budget  just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike . fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes  right    br    br   flashy  shallow  dreary  formulaic  passionless  tedious  dull  dumb  humourless  desultory  barely competent . live action anime without any action  or indeed any life . sf just the way joe fanboy likes it  in fact .    
a message movie  but a rather good one . outstanding cast  top to bottom . interesting in that bette davis  s plot line is essentially back story  the extremely negative reviews  name throwing at the screenplay  playwright  associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about  angles in america   etc . etc .  object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii . gosh  that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me .  br    br   theatrical and movie  making  and acting styles vary over time and of course   years later this particular movie would not be made in this way . yes casablanca is a better movie  i guess   but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them  casablanca is primarily a love story . the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot   more of a thriller . both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors . the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited  
while i have never been a fan of the original scooby  doo  due to its horrid production values   it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna  barbera  without a doubt  scrappy  doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children  and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm  . whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby  doo characters with it   whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show  i think death is preferable  . the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny  annoying and grates on the nerves   and this is only in the better episodes   after many years  it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess  i can see why in the live  action scooby  doo movie they made the villain scrappy  doo   since practically everyone hates him   
this is actually a trilogy of  of somerset maugham  s short tales . the first one is the verger  which is about   minutes long and very enjoyable . after   years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can  t read nor write . so what does he do  opens a tobacco shop  of course   br    br   the second is mr . know  all which was actually a story i had read for school  years ago and instantly forgotten  until i heard the familiar introduction . another   minute one  and also very good . it worked better on film than in a book for me  but then perhaps that  s because i was only   the last time  afterall .  br    br   the  rd one is nearly a let  down . almost an hour in length  it simply drags . it  s not all that bad  but not as quick and snappy as the last  . i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour  and found that it still made sense and really i hadn  t missed a thing   br    br   overall i give them     and  out of    respectively .  
wow  here it finally is the action  movie  without action . in a real low  budget setting  don  t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times  of a future seattle we find a no  brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood .  br    br   there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors  performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies  mainly  matrix  without having the money to do it right . yes  we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot  outs    secs approx .  but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody  s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then .  br    br   and  yes  we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere  as if the script was thought  out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes .  br    br   believe me  it is as bad as it possibly can get . in fact  it doesn  t deserve to be taken seriously  but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money .  
made after quartet was  trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham . here the three stories are the verger  mr . know  it  all  and sanitorium . the first two are comic  the verger is like a prolonged joke  but one with a good pay  off   and the last more serious  as health issues are involved  . again the author introduces the film and the stories .  br    br   james hayter  soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick  is the hero in the verger . he holds this small custodial  type job in a church  but the new vicar  michael hordern  is an intellectual snob . when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him . hayter has saved some money  so he tells his wife  kathleen harrison  he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop . he has a good eye  and his store thrives . soon he has a whole chain of stores . when his grandchild is christened by hordern  the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex  verger . the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments . i  ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting .  br    br   according to maugham he met a man like max kelada  nigel patrick  on a cruise . in mr . know  it  all kelada is a splashy  friendly  and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip  regarding jewelry  by steamship . his state  room mate is mr . grey  the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde  white  who is somewhat  silently disapproving of max . max likes to enliven things  and soon is heavily involved in the ship  s entertainment . at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non  maugham story and film china seas        as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake  after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real  . i won  t describe the way max rises to the occasion .  br    br   sanitorium is the longest segment . roland culver plays  ashenden   the fictional alter  ego of maugham  a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock  s the secret agent  . here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health . he finds a remarkable crew of people  including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman  finlay currie as an irascible scotsman  john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is  at war  with currie  raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up  and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness . culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions . the last  dealing with simmons and rennie  is ironic but deeply moving .  br    br   it was a dandy follow  up to the earlier quartet  and well worth watching .  
god  i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot . i had been expecting a lot from it  as i  m a huge fan of james cameron  and not just since  titanic   i might add   and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality  then again  he also wrote the leaden strange days . .  . but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration . in all that time  it barely went beyond its two line synopsis  and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere . on top of that  i don  t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular  a  team  episode . as for alba  yes  she is gorgeous  of course  but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie  pouty and surly   makes me also get bored of her  gal wit an attitude  schtick pretty soon . you can count me out of this one  mr . cameron   
wilhelm grimm  alexander knox  stands trial for nazi crimes . three witnesses give evidence  father warecki  henry travers   wilhelm  s brother karl  erik rolf  and wilhelm  s former lover marja  marsha hunt   before wilhelm speaks in his own defense . the film ends after the court sums up . . . .  br    br   the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand . the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna  shirley mills   who wilhelm is accused of raping the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps and the church service where willie grimm  richard crane  denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina  dorothy morris   marja  s daughter  after she has been shot at a brothel .  br    br   throughout the film  knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter  resentful and evil man . martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest . this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished .  
awful  simply awful . it proves my theory about  star power .  this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed  battlestar  titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick . b o r i n g .  br    br   find something a thousand times more interesting to do  like watch your tv with no picture and no sound .      i rated it so high b  c there aren  t any negative scores in the imdb . com rating system .   br    br    zaphoid  br    br   ps my theory about  star power  is the more  star power  used in a show  the weaker the show is .  it  s called an indirect proportionality quality    star power   less  sp  makes for better quality  etc . another way to look at it is  more is less .    br    br    z  
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . while late     and into     would reveal just how evil and horrific they were  this film  unlike other hollywood films to date  is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities .  br    br   the film begins in a courtroom in the future   after the war is over  the film was made in       the war ended in may       . in this fictitious world court  a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm  s life since     in a series of flashbacks . at first  it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis . however  after a while  it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster . these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama .  br    br   all in all  the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second  tier actors . there are many compelling scenes and performances   especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can  t help but bring you close to tears . it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super  creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . overall  it  s a must  see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film .  br    br   fyi   this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film  but hitler was referred to as  that paper hanger  . this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . this is in fact not true   previously he  d been a  starving artist   homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi . a horrible person  yes  but never a paper hanger   
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe . during the first season  dark angel was on my weekly  must see  list  and not just because of jessica alba .  br    br   unfortunately  the powers  that  be over at fox decided that they needed to  fine  tune  the plotline . within  episodes of the season opener  they had totally lost me as a viewer  not even to see jessica alba   . i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish . the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin . on one of the second season episodes  they even had max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically couldn  t sleep .  br    br   the moral of the story  the one that hollywood never gets   if it works  don  t screw with it   br    br   azjazz  
never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway . the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates . alexander knox   wilhelm gimm   gorky park  returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town . he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either . as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind . marsha hunt   marja pacierkowski    chloe  s prayer   played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm . there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people  s families and their entire lives . the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers . if you have not seen this film  and like this subject matter  give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a     film and a story you will not forget too quickly .  
a story of amazing disinterest kills  the psychic  over and over again . the characters and plot are completely uninteresting  as is fulci  s mad camera work  which is usually a redeeming factor in his films   and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found . it  s padded out to an insufferable degree   by the end  you won  t be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom  and  like me  maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep  . jennifer o  neill  s performance deserves occupancy in a better movie . fulci gorehounds beware   there  s just not much going on in  the psychic .   br    br        
the only reason i give this movie an  out of   is because there are few movies  in my opinion  that are perfect . this little b picture is a taut story  well told . i  ve always been intrigued by alexander knox  but have seen him very few movies . here he plays wilhelm grimm  a sad little man who turns into a monster . he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse . the performance is one of the most chilling performances i  ve ever seen . since world war   actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars . i imagine that since this was made during the war  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil . but knox puts in that kind of performance   a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer . i still can  t get over it .  br    br   marsha hunt  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly  is cast against type in probably the best performance i  ve ever seen her give  too . maybe not oscar worthy  but the best of her career . nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those  slight  roles she often played . but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama .  br    br   if you like human drama stories  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis  i highly recommend this fine little film .  
average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo which means it  s still quite bad by normal standards  but redeemed by its solid build  up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance .  br    br   the genre  s well  known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue  wooden acting  illogical plot points . and the finale goes on much too long  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair .  br    br   fulci  s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing  though . yellow clues wherever you look .  br    br    out of   limping killers  
this one is tough to watch   as an earlier reviewer says . that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii   particularly the  liberation  of dachau . it is clear that  as of the middle of the war  we knew exactly what was happening to the jews . the sequence that shows a  transport  is vivid  almost as if based upon an actual newsreel  the nazis liked to record their atrocities  . knox as the nazi is brilliant . he charts the course of a nazi career . that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans  at first laughing at hitler  then incredulous  and finally helpless . that contrast  however  permits us to believe in the  conversion  of one young nazi officer to an anti  nazi stance . that did happen  as witness the several attempts against hitler  most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out . a strong film  effectively using flashbacks  accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended .  
i was really disappointed in this movie . those that voted this thing a   have a screw lose . the acting was ok  kinda wooden and cardboard . the ending was sorry . i just didn  t care for this at all .  br    br   no way could i recommend this mess .  
this movie was extremely funny  i would like to own this for my vintage collection of     s movie must see again list  i know this cast of characters  they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy  unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs . redd foxx always a clown of comedy  pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy  norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out  dennis dugan crazy funny man . miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience . love  lust  strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance  situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake  i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible  except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role  this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you  keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent . this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie  remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer .  episode from seinfeld  the parents have there jaw dropping moment  fun over fun it is screaming bring me back .  
man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy . now most of the rest of the film was okay . it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing . yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others . the problem isn  t with direction  acting or anything technical . the movie is just destroyed in the third act . why  the murders  twists  turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material  what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that  the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history . for all the complaints about burton  s planet of the apes  the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever . what a let down .  
norman  is that you  was  this is all third hand  so take it with a grain of salt  adapted to an african american family from a jewish one  when it made the transition off stage and onto screen . also  it was one of those movies originally filmed in video  so the prints from the theater can  t have been that great . still  performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good .  br    br   what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early   s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family . for that reason alone  it  s pretty interesting  if not a little  hollywood  . don  t believe me  check out lines about curtains  etc . very stereotypical . not too deep .  br    br   but . . . the movie really shines in a couple of areas . there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife  who  s run away with his brother    to ensenada in a souped up pinto . the phone conversation across the border is really memorable .  br    br   but . . . the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his  their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs . to the best of my knowledge  this is the only time that routine was filmed . and  it  s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version  i  m told . still  it  s vintage madame  and shouldn  t be missed . people are still stealing lines from wayland the man was truly gifted . enjoy the movie   
this movie is just plain dumb .  br    br   from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax  the film is an exercise in wooden predictability .  br    br   mike hammer is one of detective fiction  s true sociopaths . unlike marlow and spade  who put pieces together to solve the mystery  hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth . this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are . . . well  too dumb to get away with anything . one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack .  br    br   other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book . velda  s dance at the barre  for instance  or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back . and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she  s way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot . the worst break  however  precedes the popcorn attack . the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero  except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy .  br    br   to be fair  there were some interesting camera angles and lighting  and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen  which is the only reason that it gets two points out of   .  
i saw a trailer for this on afro promo  the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african  americans . it looked like what it is a highly tendentious  wacky  comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay . it would seem that redd foxx  s  rf  wife has left him for his brother  who works with him at  the store  back in phoenix . he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles .  br    br   so as rf arrives  norman  wearing nothing but powder  blue bikini shorts  gets out of his waterbed to answer the door . trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the   th floor  norman tries to wake his lover  who steadfastly refuses to budge . it was just to the point where i wrote  why won  t he wake up   when suddenly he does  and me and my friend  s jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue  eyed  swirl  hairdoed garson  norman  s white live  in lover  who just  had the most faaaaaabulous dream  garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from     l . a . he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry  and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch .  br    br   norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father  s visit . garson goes to stay with waylon flowers  and madam answers the phone when norman calls .  br    br   so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico . while he is on the phone  garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him . with a burst of   s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation  but sounding more like we  re about to hear a very special track by the emotions   he realizes that his son is gay .  br    br   his first impulse is  i  ll kill him . i  ll kill him .  then rf goes on a long walk  wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have  such as  maybe we toilet trained him too soon .  his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk  for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man . surprisingly  he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality . this  it must be said  is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought . he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all   br    br   rf then hires audrey  a six  foot amazon prostitute  in this amazing fur thing  played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones . he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality  but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody .  br    br   then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night . he commiserates over the loss of rf  s wife  and tells the tale of his own mother  who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because  she was molested at a luau .  they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam  which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose . once more  mouths were agape .  br    br   so it seems that  wouldn  t ya just know it  rf and garson have a wonderful evening together  you see  staid  traditional older black men just have to see the crappy  highly  effeminate entertainment of mega  queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer  it  s really just that simple  this still does not prevent rf from yelling  rape   when garson wakes him from a bad dream . it ends less predictably than you  d think .  br    br   there was so much that was just off . what is the basis of norman and garson  s relationship  they don  t seem to have any rapport  and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out  and even when he comes around to stand up for himself  he never defends garson or talks about their relationship . there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality  and sitting right down on the park bench to read them  i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality  rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends .  br    br   other than that  it  s kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era  an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance  we could all learn to love and understand one another  and because of the whole naivet of this thing  the extreme stereotypes and message  laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated  and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past   years . i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays  female friends are desperately in love with them  and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with  and by extension convert  them .  br    br         hey  check out cinema

how did mike hammer live  in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace  nah  he  d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly  specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house  wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face  that  s how . spillane wrote trash paperbacks  for sure  but how do you make it worse  give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office  add some over  the  hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw  up the story  line by some retard  drugged out screen writer  that  s how   
say what you will about schmaltz . one beauty of this film is that it is not pro  american . it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion . it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose .  br    br   to me  the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly  bette davis  mother and brother  . as fanny says   we  ve been shaken out of the magnolias .   br    br   in today  s political climate where  led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used     to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings  we sunk to the level of the     murderers to seek blood  thirsty vengeance . it can  t all be blamed on mr . bush  after all  we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re  elected him after his lies had been exposed . now  with complete justification  we americans are reviled throughout the world .  br    br   today  we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character  but  a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts . i  m not comparing george bush to adolph hitler . but  i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror  hatred  and hyper  nationalism to do despicable things .  br    br   sadly  the blackmailer  who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement  no matter how immoral  is most like the leaders of our country  those who support them  and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand  that they can  t even be bothered to vote .  br    br   a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals .  br    br   geoff  
i grew up on scooby doo where are you  and i still love it . it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck  talespin  peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry . this show though is good for kids  the voices are good  don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy   the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation . however it is rather disappointing . i normally don  t mind scrappy  but when he appears to be like the main character  it gets annoying fast . complete with the catchphrase puppy power  scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual . also half the gang are missing after the first year  somehow it didn  t feel like scooby doo . and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal  very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies . all in all  not as bad as shaggy and scooby dooget a clue  but this show is disappointing .     for the animation  voices  theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids . bethany cox  
even though this movie came out a year before i was born  it is definetely one of my favorite comedies . it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son  s homosexuality . like most parents  he doesn  t know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like . his son  norman  is now grown up and living on his own . when his father  ben  finds out that his son is gay  he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him . the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie   when ben gets to norman  s apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it  s his son in drag   norman . . . is that you    . the movie had me laughing from start to finish . redd foxx is great . although a lot of the content is stereotypical  i didn  t find anything offensive about the way the material was handled  and it even has a good ending . highly recommended .  
this is one of the worst films i  ve ever seen . i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel  and i wish i hadn  t . i turned it off after a little less than an hour  though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes . i wish i had . it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors . unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last   or so minutes  which would be impossible  i would in no way recommend this . its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the   th century . i don  t think  as many people say that it is  that  the bell jar  is necessarily unfilmable  but this particular rendition could have been done without . i  d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .  
a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid   s this film was a huge hit for about  minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth . i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish high anxiety  the cheap detective  the black bird  don  t look now we  re being shot at . . . . . . . . . . and have no profile at all today . norman was the comedy of the month in whenever     and everyone seemed to see it  laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again . famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film  an experiment at the time  norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today . if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either . it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong . just as it should be . in fact as a groovy     film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today .  
i rented this movie from the library  it  s hard to find for good reason  purely out of curiosity . i  m a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment . the bell jar       is by far one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen . the script is horrible  not because it strays from the original novel text  but because it strays without focus or intent . the scenes are ill  constructed and don  t lead the viewer anywhere . what  s with the hokey voice over of plath  s poetry  lady lazarus has little do with greenwood  s situation plath  s poetry was completely misused . marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood  or any   year old for that matter  partly due to casting  she was   during filming  the age plath was when she died  and partly due to the fact that she can  t act . hassett is all emotion  no craft  no skill . the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what  s there  which isn  t much . the only reason i  m giving the film a  is because  isn  t an option . sorry sylvia  you  ll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting .  
melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which  this time  he inhabits the role of a detective who can  t place love before duty and adventure  and the warmly beautiful joan blondell  who  far from being illiterate  as one reviewer suggested  wrote a novel about her early life  is as enjoyable as ever as his ever  suffering sweetheart . it  s almost a screwball comedy  almost a thin man  type movie  almost a series  i guess  that didn  t quite make it to a sequel . it doesn  t quite reach classic status  but it has all the ingredients for a fun   minutes with an episodic but pacey script  fine character actors  and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don  t notice that williams  douglas  isn  t exactly columbo when it comes to detecting . i wish there were more films like this .  
jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen  s most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin . larry peerce  s direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy . robert klein certainly think it  s the former and his self  centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film . normally  i don  t like to let myself get so ascerbic  but the bell jar is one of my all  time favorite books  and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy .  
the  amazing mr . williams  stars melvyn douglas  who did five films in      one of which was ninotchka with garbo . his co  star was joan blondell  maxine   who also did five films that year  three of which they made together  douglas is lt . williams  and he and his co  horts are presented with a dead body  and they must figure out what really happened . viewers will recognize his co  workers  the actors  clarence kolb  donald macbride  don beddoe  always played positions of authority . . . senators  bank presidents  policemen . this who  dunnit has a flair of comedy to it   the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other  and even williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally . some fun gags  williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend . there  s a lot of fun stuff in here  so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on . don  t want to give away any spoilers  so you  ll have to catch it on turner classic movies . director alexander hall made mostly comedies  and was reportedly engaged to lucy at some point .  
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the   s . this show quack pack shouldn  t even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales . it  s about a teen  aged huey  dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip  hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales . i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales . there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg . there  s no references of scrooge mcduck . the stories are repetitive  the plot is boring but the animation is good . if you want lots of slapstick humor  i recommend this to you . if you want a better disney show watch  darkwing duck  or  ducktales  .  
melvyn douglas and joan blondell co  star in  the amazing mr . williams   a     mystery  comedy that  s quite good  although forgotten  probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in     .  br    br   douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job  while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed . what happens in this film is no exception  he  s called to a murder scene just as he  s about to walk down the aisle yet again .  br    br   both stars were excellent at comedy  worked together well  and often   and help make this battle of the sexes fun . edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support .  br    br   as you can read in other reviews  melvyn douglas doesn  t make much of a woman .  br    br   entertaining if a little on the long side .  br    br   one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas  one of our greatest actors . he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man . he wasn  t lazy  but rather  a very hard  working actor  who made it look easy  who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career . he just wasn  t cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system . i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in  hud  and  i never sang for my father  and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .  
saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm . several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw . first  the adults did not age when the children did for   years . several parts of the film had continuity problems  for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the   years passed .  br    br   the copy i saw was missing about   minutes or so  at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . it is too bad  because even though the script left something to be desired  bergman  russell both did fine in the film in their roles . it is a shame the large chunk is missing  but what is here is watchable .  br    br   i just wish it was all intact . the script makes little sense in that bergman  s character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults  some of the time lines don  t make sense either . there is a stock market crash that resembles     but the kids grow up to fight in world war  . all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . just wonder what was in the   gap of film i could not see as it was missing .  
the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself . i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i don  t know much about . it  s unfortunate when there aren  t many comments for a certain tile  because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast  you don  t get an idea of what to expect . i read the review before watching this title and i don  t know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from . douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered  even when the material was not the greatest . i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable . it isn  t one of the great all  time classics  but a pleasant and funny diversion  much more than you can hope for in most newer movies . if you are a fan of these stars  you will not be disappointed .  
by     columbia was a full  fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm  paramount or warners . that  s the best thing that could be said about  adam had four sons   a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman  top  billed for the first time in an american film  and warner baxter . bergman plays a frenchwoman  this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another  hired as governess to baxter  s four sons and staying on  with one interruption caused by the stock  market crash of      until the boys are grown men serving in world war i . just about everyone in the movie is so goody  good it  s a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she  s about the only watchable person in the movie even though she  s clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it  s also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous . no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted  the valley of decision  four years later .  
what was there about     that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films  well  whatever it was  the magic may also be found in this columbia picture . it  s a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show .  maltin  s movie book does not contain it .  in nearly every department  amazing mr . williams is a jewel .  br    br   it  s the story of a first  rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended . as the wedding bells are about to ring  he gets called to the scene of a murder . the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force . there are a lot of laughs in the process .  br    br   melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy . joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight . edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious .  br    br   the film goes on a bit too long  but who cares  the screwball comedies are always able to entertain  and this film belongs right in there with the best .  
you  d think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better . sadly  the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain  addled .  br    br   the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family . everything is so very peachy and swell   the family adores bergman and things couldn  t be more perfect . well  that is until the mother  fay wray  dies  the stock market crashes in      wiping out the family  s fortune  and bergman is forced to go back home to france . this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet  but not bad .  br    br   later  after the family  s fortunes have improved  bergman returns . the four boys are now all grown and there isn  t really a conceivable reason why they  d hire her once again as a governess . but  briefly  everything is swell once again . but  when wwi occurs  the four all go to war   gosh  in the midst of this  one of the sons  david  brings home his new wife  susan hayward  . miss hayward  s character is as black and white as the others  though while they are all good and swell  she  s obviously a horny she  devil . to make things worse  she comes to live in the family home while david is at war .  br    br   now here is where the movie gets really  really dumb   brain  achingly dumb . hayward begins an affair with one of david  s brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers  bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her  not hayward with jack  why   why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman  this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter  snipe once and for all  this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad . . . and most likely did the same to the audiences back in     .  br    br   the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward  s evilness to be exposed . this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess . as expected  however  the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again    happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut  hayward .  br    br   the film suffers because of poor writing . hayward  s affair made no sense   at least in how it was handled . and  having characters who are so gosh  darn good or evil  with nothing in between  sinks this movie to the level of a second  rate soap . the only thing that saves it at all is the acting    they tried as best they could with a turgid script . suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken   
delightful minor film  juggling comedy and detective  romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams  melvyn douglas  balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll  joan blondell  and his duty to the force as an ace detective .  br    br   this hodge  podge may not appeal to all viewers today  but in its day  it had something to offer every member of the movie  going family  and the resolution to the rather tired feeling  versus  duty plot is original and refreshing  and well worth the wait .  br    br    the amazing mr . williams  contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history  and its bright comic repartee sparkles . ludicrously frocked  melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines  i  d walk down main street in a turkish towel before i  d let any woman control my life   and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb  good grief  you look like my aunt nellie    br    br   the crime  solving here is standard fare  although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life .  br    br   from today  s vantage point   the amazing mr . williams  is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct  all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries . while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes  at times it is both subtle and penetrating  playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film  but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene .  
i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons . they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film . warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our   th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr  s character .  br    br   like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i  in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed .  br    br   but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things  that  s susan hayward  s job here . in one of her earliest prominent roles  hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son  has an affair with another  and starts making a play for the third . it  s an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live .  br    br   i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays  everyone is afraid to tell father what  s going on . the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman . here  s where the plot gets a little silly . bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids . wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business . bergman has to be let go . she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up .  br    br   i  m sorry  but i can  t believe the kids need a governess now . hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn  t the kids who brought her back . in the normal course of things  bergman would have gotten on with her life .  br    br   one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out . possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have .  br    br   it  s too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback .  br    br   susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons . and i  m willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor .  
this movie is very good . the screenplay is enchanting . but meryl streep is most impressive . her performance is excellent . she brings me to go into the heart of her role .  
i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever . i didn  t realize it was disney until it was too late . i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story . it was as if someone made a movie out of a  th grader  s book report on the novel . meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses . mrs murray  meg  s mother  was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet . and that  s just the beginning . by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen  much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn  t read the book . i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one . the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book  this movie is kinda alright .  
this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all . generally speaking  i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories . and this one is great  besides meryl  s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise  the movie  s greatest asset is the story it is based on . the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture  after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye  opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans  and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society . it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people  the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example  are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would  for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices  shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions . the other face of the so  called  civilized  society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings  needless to say  this is very general  even though this specific tale unfolds in australia   that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty . must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought  provoking .  
first of all  i am a huge fan of madeleine l  engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books  a wrinkle in time . this movie  however  ruined that excitement for me . i am sorry  but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool . in the movie  she has straight hair and no glasses and is the  sporty type  with a deep voice . this is not how madeleine l  engle pictured meg to be at all . in fact  meg was based on madeleine  s character and depicted the way she felt when she was young . this is just one major example how the book and movie are different . so i would say  if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes  watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l  engle and her wrinkle in time series  i would suggest skipping this movie .  
i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in      though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness . the film is set in       just before the entry of the us into the war . paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . he  s a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture . bette davis is his very understanding and long  suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . as the film begins  they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years  they are going to relax and stop running .  br    br   the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent   making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . while this had a very noble goal at the time  it just seems phony today . in particular  the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn  t ring true . it sounded more like anti  fascism speeches than the voices of real children . they were as a result extremely annoying   particularly the littlest one who came off  at times  as a brat . about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them  though he had no discernible accent  .  br    br   it  s really tough to believe that the ultra  famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog  as it just doesn  t sound true to life . the story was based on the play by his lover  lillian hellman . and  the basic story idea and plot is good  . . . but the dialog is just bad at times . overall  an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments  . . . but that  s really about all .  
after the success of scooby  doo  where are you  they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show . but unfortunately  they added a new character that spoilt scooby  doo success forever . they invented a new show with a new title  scooby and scrappy  doo . it was scrappy  doo that made this show a complete failure  probably for both adults and kids together . scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain  and they were also trying to stop him . scooby  doo doesn  t need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . if they wanted scooby  doo to be more successful  they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy . this was just poor  maybe your kids will prefer it   
i believe they were telling the truth the whole time . . u cant trust anything in the wild . . . they family went through hell . those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them . but still having to deal with the rumours . as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister . i cant believe this case went on for so long . seems like the jury couldn  t see the truth  even if it bit them on the ass . i feel for this family  and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them  i would . i have no idea what they went through  i cant even imagine it . after watching this movie  i was in tears  and had to check on my little girl in bed . . . i think everyone should watch this .  
we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books . while not particularly accurate adaptations  these movies were nonetheless excellent films . some great examples are the harry potter series  the lord of the rings trilogy  and  to a lesser extent  almost every disney film ever made . however  i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies . not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l  engle  s fan base  it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting  acting  special effects and  ultimately  respect for the audience . mind you  i  m not trying to be mean on the contrary  i went into this affair with an open mind . i figured that a made  for  t . v . movie would make up for its lack of razzle  dazzle in its script . after all  the star wars spin  off ewoks was decent  if a little silly . come to think of it  the original star wars was made on  a lunch money budget   and look where it took george lucas  however  from the first scene onward  disappointment started enveloping me as if i  d gotten too close to the black thing while tessering .  br    br   the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of      a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic   mrs . whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time . the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief . aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard  star trek first contact and radio  as our favorite star  turned  mentor  the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow . that  s right  a crow . moreover  the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight  year  old the majestic half  man  half  horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle . had i been five  this would have psychologically traumatized me for life . the worst part is the fact that when it spoke  it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync  resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single  unmoving cheek  thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e . t .  br    br   having gotten the most painful part out of the way  i must go on to the tear  inducing one the characters  the acting  and the story . i  personally  had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair  glasses  and a figure most supermodels would find laughable . she was always a slightly anxious  humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua . in the film  she is an unpleasant know  it  all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever . in fact  she makes me feel sorry for poor mr . jenkins  her school principal  who continuously has to deal with her . calvin  the kind  intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock  the irony is horrible . as for the memorable happy medium  they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is  above gender  and likes to look at  funny  things  such as girls falling off of swings . the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace  mrs . whatsit and the man with red eyes  nicknamed  the dude with red eyes  due to his complete reinvention as a character  .  br    br   the story is a mess . a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  which didn  t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book  yet kept the sole of the original work . here  the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld  apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed . as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen  the flat  nosed wookies of ixchel  who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks  tear the spine up . as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth  like camazotz was  the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil .  br    br   i am very sorry that this film exists . i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad . it  s the way the characters are written that ruins it . a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan  directed by george lucas or steven spielberg  enhanced at industrial light and magic  scored by john williams  given its sound at skywalker sound  edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox . in its current state  the film is unworthy to be shown to self  respecting people . even madeleine l  engle thought it was bad . the book was good  the film was bad  and mrs . whatsit was ugly .  br    br   score  .      if i could   br    br   pros  br    br   they got the names right .  br    br   cons  br    br   it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation  script  acting and special effects  not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book . oh  and the main cover  poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle . some might say that this symbolizes high adventure . i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn  t even bother to photoshop meg  s arm on properly .  
when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock  australia  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press  and the whole thing turns into a circus . lindy doesn  t help matters either because she won  t play to the jury or courtroom  she  s only herself  and she  s a tough nut to crack  so of course everyone thinks she  s guilty because there  s a piece of evidence that hasn  t come to light . sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain  a seventh  day adventist pastor  who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . it  s good  or bad  to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too  because the australian public doesn  t believe the story and the media only fans the flames . eventually  lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor  but years later  a missing piece of evidence shows up and she  s freed  but not until after the family  s life is basically ruined . a heart  breaking story  very well done  a bit long but well worth seeing .  out of   .  
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie . all of the fascinating points in the book didn  t even exist in the movie . they ended up turning it into a cheesy  tween  disney movie  crush  story between meg and calvin . it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part  or one of the likes . this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book . i can  t believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap  basic rendition . if you  ve ever read the book  i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of  lord of the rings  equivalence . this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time . poorly done .  
religious bigotry is rampant everywhere . australia is not immune to it .  br    br   a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having  killed  her own baby . i don  t mean to spoil the story for you  but you need to know the basics before getting knee  deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison .  br    br   buy or rent the movie and discover how deep  seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe .  br    br   this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors .  br    br   both meryl streep  with her famous aussie accent  and sam neill  whose accent is his native  born pronunciation  are outstanding . those with supporting roles are also quite good .  br    br   you will remember this movie for many years .  br    br   see it   
i only recently found out that madeleine l  engle  s novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd . the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times .  br    br   despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel  the murry family is well cast  with a likable  if too pretty  meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating .  br    br   the first half hour is promising enough  doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene . unfortunately as soon as the non  human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart . alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit  think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead  and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive  she must have visited faye dunaway  s plastic surgeon in recent years . for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west .  br    br   in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction . i understand that this is a tv movie  but the cgi looked like something that could have been done   years earlier . mrs whatsits  centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast  who in the novel is a velvety  elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here . i could go on and on  nearly every artistic choice is a disaster  presumably because there wasn  t a large enough budget to do this justice  but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement .  br    br   this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films . what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children  s literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it  s sequels for the big screen  giving it the scope it deserves .  
this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based .  br    br   the right to be presumed  innocent until proven guilty  is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi  s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial  it was not granted to lindy chamberlain  accused of killing her baby . the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely  a dingo was alleged to have taken it   but those implying her guilt even more so  and there was no solid evidence against her . but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt  and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media  and the media themselves  of course  were anything but innocent in this process  . so although cleared by an initial inquest  they were later prosecuted and convicted . although chamberlain was eventually released  this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence  proving  their innocence  something no defendants should have to produce .  br    br    a cry in the dark  is well acted throughout  especially by meryl streep  who puts on a convincing australian accent  at least to this pom  s ears  and manages keep lindy sympathetic  to us  while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure . the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking  because we believe in the characters as real .  br    br   regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story  something i can  t comment on   the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership  s least charitable instincts . no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away . i  m not a religious man  but the bible still contains some killer lines  if you  ll excuse the pun  .  judge not lest ye be judged  is one of them .  
i have never read the book  a wrinkle in time  . to be perfectly honesty  after seeing the movie  do i really want to  well  i shouldn  t be reviewing this movie i  ll start off with that . next i  ll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable . do you know why i say that  because i forgot what happens in it . i told you it was forgettable . to be perfectly honest  no tv movie will ever be better than  merlin  .  br    br   how do i describe a tv movie  i have never written a review for one before . well  i  ll just say that they usually have some celebrities . a wrinkle in time includes only one . alfre woodard  or woodward  i am not sure   the oscar winner .  br    br   the film has cheesy special effects  a mildly interesting plot  scenes that make you go  wtf  . the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go  wtf  . what did i expect  it  s a tv movie . they usually aren  t good . as is this one . a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster . to top it off  you  ll most likely forget about it the second it  s over . well  maybe not the second it  s over . but within a few minutes .  br    br   a wrinkle in time    
a cry in the dark  br    br   a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid  if unremarkable film . this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep  s best actress nomination  the movie received little attention from major awards groups .  br    br   little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama  well  constructed on every level . if you ask me  this is an under  appreciatted classic .  br    br   the film opens rather slowly  letting the audience settle into the chamberlain  s at a relaxed pace and really notice that  at the core  they are an incredibly loving  simple family . fred schepisi  the director  selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy  while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy  streep  and michael  sam neill  chamberlain care for their children .  br    br   while the famous line  a dingo took my baby   has become somewhat of a punchline these days  the movie never even comes close to laughable . the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured . it is subtle and realistic  leaving the audience horrified and asking questions .  br    br   the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain  s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court  which suspects lindy of murder .  br    br   the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping . as an audience member  i was fully invested in the chamberlain  s plight . . . and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media . but at the same  the media  public opinion is understandable . i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic  but they always had valid reasons to hold their views .  br    br   the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas .  br    br   in terms of performances  the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill . . . and they deliver in every way . for me  this ranks as one of  if not    meryl streep  s best performances . for all her mastery of different accents  which of course are very impressive in their own right   streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters . i find this to be one of streep  s more subtle performances  and she hits it out of the park . and neill  an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park  is a perfect counterpoint to streep  s performance . from what i  ve seen  this is undoubtedly neill  s finest work to date . it  s a shame he wasn  t recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep  s . . . b  c the two of them play of each other brilliantly .  br    br   more emotionally gripping than most films  and also incredibly suspenseful . . . a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations . i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams  the dingo took my baby   watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line .  br    br   . . . a . . .  
i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie . having fond memories of the book as a child  i decided to check this out . this is a movie that you should really pass on .  br    br   it is just not worth seeing . it is very boring and uninteresting . i feel that it would even be that way to small children . it has no magic that the book contains . this movie is not horrible  but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it .  br    br   there are moments that just come off as weird . the witch character is not very good . the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening . i know this is a kids movie  so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things  but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before .  br    br   the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film  and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix . i really didn  t care how it finished . skip this film and read the book instead .  
fascinating movie  based on a true story  about an australian woman  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  accused of killing her baby daughter . she insists that a dingo took her baby  but the story is highly suspicious . the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case  the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media  and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman  s conviction  based on barely any hard evidence . i love films that question the media  and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . i  ve always thought that juries ought to be showed   angry men before they go through with their duties . it  s not  as has often been said  a liberal movie  but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . a cry in the dark is likewise clinical . schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . some may find the film boring or dry  but i found it engaging .  
i have loved this book since my  th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . and i have read it to every one of my  rd and  th grade classes over my past   years of teaching . supposedly a movie had been made in the past  but i  d never been able to locate it . well  my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l  engle  s excellent book to the screen .  br    br   as i watched the movie  i had the highest of hopes . as the film went on  i became more and more despondent . they had botched it badly  never had i been so let down by a favorite book  to  film adaption . i understand that films can  t stick strictly to a book  but they don  t need to change things for the sake of it  most  if not all  of departures from the book were totally unnecessary   br    br   i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . well  it wasn  t just me . nearly every single one felt the same way   cheated out of the great story that madeline l  engle had so skillfully created   br    br   why  they wondered  did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie  why couldn  t calvin  s hair have been red  why did mrs . which not have the proper  witch  like  outfit that was such a clever play on her name  basically  we all wondered   why did nearly every single detail have to be changed   br    br   i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . i am still waiting for that movie . this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses . i  m going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task   
in august     the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation . the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood . what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice .  br    br   michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock  central australia  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area . no  one believed them . lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael as an accessory after the fact . the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing . the chamberlain  s trial was over before it began .  br    br   lindy never proved her innocence  so she was found guilty . there was never enough evidence to convict her  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure . how could we as a nation even sit in judgement  from where we are  how could we possibly presume to know  unless there was absolute proof  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever  the chamberlains should have been acquitted .  br    br   fred schepisi  s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson  s novel  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them . that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock .  br    br   schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation  hell bent on  the truth  being brought to light . he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay  his screenplay  co  written with robert caswell  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred .  br    br   the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts . she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight . even her accent is almost  but not quite  spot on . a very good effort by the master of that trade . sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart  and he starts to question his christianity . his  as was streep  s  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly . the entire support cast are also excellent  with some of australia  s finest actors and actresses playing a part .  br    br   technically the film is brilliant too  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  especially the rock  . editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score .  br    br   for all aussies this is a must see  a shocking look in the mirror if you will  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served  and the truth to be known . as michael chamberlain said   i don  t think anybody really understands what innocence means . . . . . to innocent people .   br    br   saturday  may         video  br    br   even on return viewings fred schepisi  s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in      is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving .  br    br   schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson  s novel to the screen  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down .  br    br   amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact . what followed was little more than trial by media  and with the australian people determined she be put away  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence .  br    br   meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence . she is truly awesome  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent  though she does her level best to sound ocker . you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn  t cast in the role  but star power is probably the answer . alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes  while he feels powerless to do anything about it . a strong aussie cast lend compelling support .  br    br   editing from jill bilcock is very timely  ian baker  s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton  s music is perfect for the part . truly a must for all conscientious australians .  br    br

  this may be a bit on the spoilerish side  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed . that of course is the problem with taking  what many believe to be an amazing book  and turning it into a disney made  for  tv movie .  br    br   a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago . it  s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults . plus it  s got built in quality sequels . but disney  fying was not the way to go . the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book . it is a complicated and emotional story for kids . there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  psychic   because that was the easiest way of explaining it . there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs . w  s as added tension  there is enough tension in the story without that . there was no reason to remove meg  s glasses . . . that deprived us of what could  ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book .  br    br   i could nitpick for days about little things  but i also think larger things  like the art direction was a off . take for instance the way they made camazotz look  with its strangely darkened skies . the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth . it looks like earth . it has people on it that look like humans . the skies are blue  the grass is green  and there are children playing . but something is a little bit off . the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie . the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth  that is if we forget how to love . it would  ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they  re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm .  br    br   i unfortunately did not watch the end . maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well .  br    br   overall an artistic disappointment .  br    br    
i found it hard to like anyone in this film . the central characters  lindy and michael chamberlain  whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback  are not bad people  but then surely not all  or even most  of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better . but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life  s tragic disarray  the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip  news media  crowds  mobs and assumptions . it  s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it  s merely an account of a true story that happened there . society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are .  br    br   when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine  s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog  when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines  newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy  there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one  s own unaware perceptions  influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one  s life . the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out  from the victims to the masses .  br    br   the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside  suspicion was jet  fueled mostly by a virtue of hers . to the public eye  she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter . why was she able to keep her cool  even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up  for tv and the press  how much of the downward spiral could  ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public  s liking in the media  meryl streep  one of  if not the  greatest actress working today  may not give a performance that particularly stands out  and frankly neither does any other actor  or department of film  making . but she  and the screenwriters  do understand lindy . what is infuriating is that it  s not that difficult . apparently  she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case . whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense  we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation .  br    br   whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie  s choice  the devil wears prada  angels in america or other such work  it is a triumph . it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself . she frustrates us because we don  t know what she  s thinking or feeling . it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her  but this is the movie  s way of suggesting the reaction of the public  s attention .  br    br   she is married to a pastor  and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most . initially  they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god  s will  kick  starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter  s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part . whatever happened to the little girl  her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media  s intake didn  t immediately identify  so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry . . . well . . .  br    br   meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen  but the australian public plays the real leads here . like punctuation for each plot advance  director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office  where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections .  br    br   this golan  globus docudrama is not particularly memorable . the setting  s atmosphere doesn  t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out . but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public .  
i really didn  t like this movie because it didn  t really bring across the messages and ideas l  engle brought out in her novel . we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it  i  m afraid i can  t say the same for the film . there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn  t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l  engle  this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating . don  t see this movie if you are a big fan of l  engle  s texts because you will be sorely disappointed . however  if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes  or educational as was my case  then it is an alright movie   
i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story . several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie . the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself . the cast just makes it that much more appealing . meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture . she nails mrs . chamberlain  s mannerisms  the accent  and even look . she shows the pain  hurt  surprise  and anger that lindy had to endure  and in the process it  s hard to remember that it isn  t lindy . in my opinion  this performance of meryl  s was better than her oscar  winning turn in  sophie  s choice   and should have garnered her her third oscar . sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain  and for some surprising reason  wasn  t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination . in all  this movie only receive one oscar nod  streep  s for best actress .  however  it did receive several australian oscars and nominations .  br    br   definitely a top  rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast .  
i have read the whole  a wrinkle in time  book and then saw the movie . the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was    pages and the film was  hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting .  br    br   a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg  charles wallace  and calvin must team together to find meg  s father and get off the island camazotz .  br    br   the beginning of the film is really a stinker . the acting is awful  the direction is laughable  and so far the situations aren  t necessary . i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie  made a great book  and a terrible film . the acting is worse than any straight  to  video acting . yes  i got to admit there was cool effects . but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible . if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie . i wish could give it a  but sadly i can only give it  . a half could have been useful .  
meryl streep is such a genius . well  at least as an actress . i know she  s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents  but she nails the accent every time . her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring . mrs . chamberlain  as portrayed here  was not particularly likable  nor all that smart . but that just makes streep  s work all the more remarkable . i think she is worth all   or so of her oscar nominations . about the film  well  there were a couple of interesting things . i don  t know much about australia  but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story . i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago  but it came through loud and clear yesterday . and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery  inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues . a pretty good film . a bit different . grade b  
the  wrinkle in time  book series is my favorite series from childhood . i have read and re  read them more times than i can count over the last    years . the characters  with all their virtues and flaws  are near and dear to my heart . this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful  magical  spiritual story that i love so much . to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement .  br    br   if you have never read the book  s  i imagine you will enjoy the movie . the acting is passable  the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie  and the story is interesting . however  if you love the books  avoid this movie at all costs .  br    br   i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel  in an interview with newsweek  l  engle said of the film   i expected it to be bad  and it is .    br    br   i  like another reviewer here  feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .  
this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor . i don  t see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor  i just don  t think she did a very good job . bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie . they are going by train to davis  s relatives house . davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest . but when they arrive home  their is a nazi living there and their  s not much either can do about it . it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas . their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself .  
horrible acting  horrible cast and cheap props . would  ve been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie . what a waste . starting from the name of the movie .  br    br    the enemy  naming it  action movie  would  ve made it better .  contributing to the parody effect  . the cop looking like a   year old player  the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times . towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie . horrible . don  t waste your time .  
this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it  s impact on australian society . it especially looks at the problem of innuendo  gossip and expectation when dealing with real  life dramas .  br    br   one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations . not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis . just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so . this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings . it  s an issue that has to be constantly addressed .  br    br   the leads play the characters with depth  personality and sensitivity . and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based  on  fact individuals . some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors . it re  enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals .  br    br    spoiler warning    br    br   i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex  adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most . i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality  and emotional heart . i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers . it captured the themes of the story brilliantly .  br    br   i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  play the best case for their character they could  . while this is especially apt for this story  i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well .  
i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it . the movie  however  did not meet my expectations . having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . the characters didn  t seem to fit very well with the book . the direction was weak . i had a hard time getting into the characters . there wasn  t a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . the dialog didn  t explain adequately what was happening . it just seemed slapped together and rushed through . all in all i was very disappointed with the movie . i suppose if you haven  t read the book  it might be ok by itself . at the very least  it might entice you to read the book  which you  ll probably enjoy more .  br    br    
once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they . . . somehow . . . managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended  you  ll find that it  s not half bad . the plot is engaging and interesting  and the pacing is fast  with this covering many situations  and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken . where this really stands out is the acting . the performances are excellent . neill and streep are both impeccable . it  s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film  and even those who don  t come naturally to it at least attempt an accent . the cinematography and editing are nice enough  but they don  t really go beyond the standard stuff . this movie  s story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling . while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture  i understand that it is quite close to the truth . there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this . it is  at times  a downright great courtroom drama . i recommend this to any fellow fan of such .      
this abc straight  to  tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time . ms . madeleine l  engle brought children and adults alike into a magical  fantastical and original world like no author before her . this novel  the first in her  time quartet   is a beautiful take on life  the universe  and time itself . yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand . its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book . this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms . l  engle  s work of art . honestly  what were they thinking  the effects look cheap and ridiculous  the plot is mushy and uneven  the dialogue is far  fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost . this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen . i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent  worthy director  guillermo del toro  david yates  alfonso cuarn  makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece . this adaptation can only be compared to boring  fake and cheap motel  room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience .  
meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense . based on the book  evil angels  and titled so in its australian release  a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch . it presents a scenario that  s all too real for us in america the witch  hunt against a person deemed an easy target .  br    br   lindy chamberlain was this woman . being someone who spoke her mind  someone who didn  t play the sympathy card  and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal  she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn  t kill her own child . the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece . and through it all  lindy remained as stoic as ever  even when her husband michael was falling apart .  br    br   this stance  of course  is the power of strength  as unsympathetic as it may look like  and people happen to react strongly to that . they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn  not sit there and look blank . people don  t understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations . meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold  but not unfeeling woman  one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty . because of her  sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair   someone has to  or the chamberlains would be too detached  and no one wants to see that . except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news  media . they  ll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public .  
disney  what happened  i really wish the movie had been set in the    s like the book was . and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption . . . . . i  m glad that  maybe  someone might be influenced to read the books . . . . . but  the man with red eyes interchangeable as it  and what  s up with the volcanic upheaval  where was that in the book  peter jackson  save us     a long time ago       i heard that there was european version of this film . i sure wish i could id it . i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption . this movie needs to be x  d .  
spoilers following i picked up the book  evil angels  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case . just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain  s guilt . the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did . john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  and picked up by the press  of the arterial spray  the actelone     plates  dr . james cameron  s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up  bloody hand print  etc . all quite convincingly . after all  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn  t apparent to me at all . it was also highly technical evidence  difficult for a layman to understand . to this point  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn  t believe it was possible . the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists  whose origins made them appear to be a cult  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt . were it not for dedicated  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony  finding azaria  s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail . the book shook me for that reason  and i  ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone  s guilt ever since  excepting oj of course  . i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don  t think it could have been done better . i  ve always liked sam  who i could identify with completely  and meryl was perfect as always . beautiful photography  haunting music . i think it  s not only a very good  but a very important  movie . too bad it didn  t receive more publicity at the time it was released .  
i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles . my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time  and would think  what an amazing movie this would make . sadly enough that screenwriter failed  changing characters  throwing in lame humor  and all out destroying the plot . i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie . but why can  t you stay true to the book  why must you change the way characters think and act  for those of you who have not read the book  pick it up  find a soft couch  and let your imagination run wild .  
lindy  meryl streep  and her husband michael  sam neill  have just welcomed a baby girl  azaria . as seventh day adventists  they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church  with their two older boys looking on . michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer  s rock  one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia . not being wealthy  the family camps near the site . after a wonderful first day  lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents . suddenly  she hears azaria crying . as lindy rushes to the tent  a dingo dog is just exiting  shaking his head . the baby is gone and soon  so is the dingo . although the entire camp looks for the baby  she is not found . concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child  the chamberlains struggle to accept god  s decision and go on with their lives . but  unfortunately  the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby . she is subsequently arrested and put on trial . how could this happen  this is a great depiction of real events that shows how  mob rule  is not a figment of the imagination . the entire country turns against the chamberlains  in part because they are seen as odd . streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy  whose own strong  willed demeanor works against her every step of the way . neill  likewise  does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael . the cast is one of the largest ever  with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy  s case . the costumes  scenery  script  direction and production are all top of the line . if you have never seen or heard of this film  remedy that straight away . it is not a far cry from reality to say that this  cry  should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media .  
the book is so good that at least the opening of this made  for  tv movie will move you  but then  as it diverges more and more from the book  taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches  it becomes boring . still  from comments i  ve heard  people who have not read the book tend to like it  and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time  it will have served its purpose . the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins  uncle albert  i love to laugh  . nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .  
this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears . meryl streep is excellent  as always  and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn  t particularly likable .  br    br   the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the    s . these real  life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled . i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating  why isn  t sam sheppard in jail   . the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure  and sheppard was tried and convicted . only after years in jail was he exonerated .  br    br   i love movies which tell a true story  do it in an interesting way  and make an important point in the process . this is one of those movies . other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include  hurricane    the thin blue line   and  breaker morant  . in particular  the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended .  br    br        
awful . this thriller should have buried . what a piece of crap . terrible writing  characters are less than believable . horrible schlock   stick some b  stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit  but it fails miserably . if i didn  t have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review  it starts with  sh  and ends with  it  .  br    br   horrible ending  retarded . who writes this crap . the ending of this film is so contrived  weak it  s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line  or they just ran out of money . most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie . it  s a good thing that these actors are on the way out  because this would be a career killer . good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it . at least no one important  like future investors . it could have ended a thousand different ways  but as it is  i feel cheated out of my precious time .  br    br   don  t bother with this one  you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .  
an unqualified    .  the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of  old  hollywood . sam neill and meryl streep are very good together . neill matches streep line for line  and take for take   it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best  notwithstanding the intensity of his role . this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama  portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms . the movie   which won several top awards in australia   boasts not only a superlative cast and director  but wonderful and authentic australian locales . it proves that people are the same the world over . and  after all these years  people still delight in repeating the famous streep line  accent and all  a dingo ate moy baby   including that imp  elaine benis  on  seinfeld .   
these were over   minutes of semi unexpected boredom . first  i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that . then  reaching   th minute i was convincing myself that it  s only a few more minutes  and i lasted to the very end which i  m kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for human  s patience and crap tolerance . was it worth watching at all  well  as i wrote above  if you want to test yourself  give it a try and if you  re strong willed enough  you may even last to the end . . . the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all . all happenings in the movie  you can be sure you saw somewhere before  and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel .  
when i first saw  a cry in the dark   i had no idea what the plot was . but when i saw it  i was shocked at what it portrayed . when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class  i realized a second point communication issues . you see  when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain  s  meryl streep  baby  she and her husband michael  sam neill  were grief  stricken but didn  t show it . as seventh day adventists  they believed that god willed this to happen  and so they couldn  t mourn it . but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness  everyone started believing that lindy did it herself .  br    br   the point is  the wrong message got communicated to the public  and it turned people against lindy . even though this was a pure accident  it still happened . it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media  regardless of any media outlet  s political views .  br    br   as for the performances  streep does a very good job with an australian accent  no surprise there   and sam neill is equally great . you will probably get blown away just by what you see here . definitely one of fred schepisi  s best movies ever .  
this movie was poorly written  poorly acted and very predictable . it was very low  budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video . it wasn  t even campy fun  it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the      hours back  the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them .  br    br   the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing   what a stretch  skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre . just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this .  br    br   ejames      
meryl streep was incredible in this film . she has an amazing knack for accents  and she shows incredible skill in this film overall . i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted . she was played realistically  too . she got cranky  upset  and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt . i didn  t expect much from the film initially  but i really got interested in it  and the movie is based on a real person and real events . it turned out to be better than i had anticipated . sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work i  ve seen from him  and i  ve really liked him in other movies  the piano  for example  . i gave the film a   but if i could rate just the acting  i  d give the it a  .   and a perfect   for streep .  
this  movie  is such a bad work  nothing seems to even try and be realistic . plot is weak  acting  miserable  actors wondering around like in a  st year production  trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning . what a flop  what a waste of time  money and effort to all concerned including the audience . well  as in any thriller  here too are murders  corpses and blood . just imagine someone who  minutes ago  committed a murder with a knife  and came out calm and smiling  not to mention clean as a whistle  as if slashing one  s throat is done by a virtual agent . also  this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male  and she cut his throat    did she ask him  politely  to bend down for her  much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one . continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager  hungry groom is lying in bed  waiting for his virgin  bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while  falls asleep      . next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception  area  asking for guidance to scenery spots  not a word about last night    such a waste of time even to try and write about this low  low supposed  to  be  movie  .  
  a cry in the dark  is a masterful piece of cinema  haunting  and incredibly though provoking . the true story of lindy chamberland  who  in      witnessed a horrific sight  seeing her   month  old baby being brutally taken from their family  s tent  while camping on the austrailian outback . azaria  the baby  was never seen again  and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world . meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy  as she always does . but the one thing that helps  a cry in the dark  never fall flat is the brilliant direction . a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case  tears are brought to the eyes . the concept is nothing less then terrifying  and afterwards you are left haunted  but also inspired .  
as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face . talk about insulting . i was writing better stories than this in  th grade . bad acting  bad writing  bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure .  br    br   the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time . who would green light something so poorly written  it  s not artistic  clever  smart  suspenseful  mysterious  scary  dramatic  nothing .  br    br   the characters are flat and boring with no development . the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can . they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next  pulp fiction  . this script should have been used to line a bird cage  not a movie .  br    br   oh and last but not least  a       lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow .  br    br   avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std .  
watch on the rhine is one of the best anti  nazi propaganda films made during world war two . paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar . bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was . i would recommend this film to those interested in that era  and  of course  the fabulous films of the late  great  ms . bette davis .  
ho  hum . an inventor  s  horst buchholz  deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands . unknowingly his son  luke perry  has been working on the antedote all along . enter cia agent olivia d  abo and the cat  and  mouse car chases and gunfire begins . also in the cast aretom conti  hendrick haese and an aging roger moore . moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts . perry fans will be accepting . d  abo is wrong for the role  but nice to look at .  
some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them . as i watched this film  made in      in      i thought i was watching the o . j . simpson debacle  although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation  .  br    br   the australian news media  if this movie is to be believed  devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought . it was scary to see the scenes of invasive  swarming media hordes  ridiculous accounts of half  truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society .  br    br   equally appalling is the media  s depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case . i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case  the accused are seven  day adventists  .  br    br   today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important .  br    br   streep is excellent as usual  and this is the best i  ve ever seen sam neill . the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible .  
i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie  really . unhappily  i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it . especially  when it  s such a classic or what people use to call a classic . i think that this is one of those movies every movie  lover should have watched at least one time  so that was why i watched it . don  t get me wrong  i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors  but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion . no really good plot  neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story . well  not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres . only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether  bogey  and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another . i think  to have and have not  is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the     s .  
this is an extremely  powerful based  on  a  true story film that can be infuriating to watch . i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people  in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby .  br    br   meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good . let  s just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent .  she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts .   br    br   without giving anything away  all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .  
or  marlowe at sea  . yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey . quite talky  too . bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation  never nervous  no matter how dangerous a situation  calls women  slim  and  dames  and other such nonsense  is the only  real male  i . e . alpha male in the movie  the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo  but he is only a fat alpha male male   and  naturally  every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction . the character clichs are all here . bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic  about  to  reform as in  casablanca   and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them  but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him  it doesn  t  so he can  t be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the  cool lone cynic  and yet a well  meaning humanitarian . i don  t think so . . . bacall does her non  chalant  cool babe  routine for the first time  and there are plenty of overrated  not all  too interesting so  called  sexual innuendo  exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by today  s standards .  just purse your lips and whistle . . .  . a load of crap . . . she was   when this was made but looks a lot older  and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day . her bony face  with its sharp features  is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland  the cuteness of a myrna loy  let alone the likability of an irene dunne . bacall was more suited for playing vampires  not femme  fatales .  in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch .  there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character . there are two or three bad musical numbers  but my fast  forward button was ready .  br    br   if you  re interested in reading my  biographies  of bogart  bacall  huston  and other hollywood personalities  contact me by e  mail .  
roll is a wonderful little film . toby malone plays an   year old kid  very well acted  by the way  who is into soccer . malone  s cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags  a drug lord  some tough bikers  some cops  and some prostitutes . . . and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law  what the contents of either gym bag is  and even what gender a key biker is . parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels .  br    br   for me  roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll . those opinions are  . i really want to visit australia one day . the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation .  br    br    . some of the best filmmakers in the are australian . the cinematography in roll was especially impressive . i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes .  br    br    . australian women are hot   
i enjoyed the first reviewer  s comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second  run theatre in the early     s . i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings . but to me  the cast was largely squandered  their personalities muffled by the masks  while the direction i think of as being unusually static  and the photography murky . the rating jotted down at the time was a nought  which means  not worth sitting through even once  .  br    br   still  i too would jump at a chance to have a second look .  
mat spirogolou  s  toby malone  family know he is a talented footballer  and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club . they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him .  br    br   but the cousins are like chalk and cheese one a naive farm boy  the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters . mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day .  br    br   having missed his cousin george  damien robertson  on arrival in the city  mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one .  br    br   toby malone  probably better known for his work in theatre  puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager . there are telltale signs of a low budget  but as with so many other low  budget movies there  s more fun  seemingly more spontaneity  and more charm  than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster .  
this is one of those films that i could only sit through once . charlotte henry is fine   in fact  all the actors were fine . the problem was in the script  the dialog  the direction  the editing  the sets and the special effects . granted  this was      but it really creaked . part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen  gary cooper  w . c . fields and cary grant are not recognizable  there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming  . the movie just clumped along with no cohesion . much of lewis carrols spirit  humor and continuity are missing . what a pity  it  s such a great book . i would recommend disney  s     version .  
i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced   mins of roll .  br    br   roll is about a country boy  mat  toby malone  who has dreams of becoming a sports star . mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george  damien robertson  . well  that was the plan anyway . george is involved with a gangster  tiny  john batchelor  and is making a delivery for him . needless to say  mat gets dragged into george  s world .  br    br   i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little . toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job .  br    br   every character in the movie complimented each other very well  the two cops were great . david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie . tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters  pando  from two hands .  br    br   one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for   years  perth and fremantle . it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with  especially the old ferris wheel .  br    br   this rocks  n  rolls  
a family moves into a old house in japan . but there  s a catch it  s haunted  boo     . aw  didn  t mean to make you jump . it  s only a review . settle back down . ahem  now anyways it  s haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife  her lover in slow motion . this naturally makes a  minutes scene stretch out to about  or  . horrid acting . horrid story . but how bad can it be you ask  well it was so bad my brain started to melt  leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips . it was so bad whenever doug mcclure came on  screen i prayed that i had flashbacks of small wonder  yes  i know doug was in  out of this world   not  small wonder   but it  s pretty much the same damn show   i can hum the  small wonder  theme better  there are movies that are so bad they  re good . this isn  t one of those  br    br   where i saw it showtime beyond  br    br   my grade f   br    br   eye candy mako hattori gets topless  susan george gets  love scenes  one nude  one just topless   br    br    
a country  boy aussie  rules player  mat  goes to the city the night before an all  important afl trial match  where he is to be picked up by his cousin . and then things go wrong .  br    br   his no  hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan  shark  drug  dealer tiny  who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian  . needless to say  mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos  and it isn  t long before thoughts of tomorrow  s match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night  s frantic events unravel .  br    br   accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country  boy mat  and successfully plays a part well below his age . best support comes from john batchelor as tiny  and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events . roll is fast  paced  often funny  and a very worthwhile use of an hour .  
this is a rotten movie . the cast seem to know just how bad it was . it starts badly and by the end is truly bad . the acting is woeful . the script could of been written on the spot . and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes . crap  out of    
i  ve just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be . toby malone  s performance really stood out  i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film  which itself is a lot of fun  very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters  quite an achievement considering it  s short running time . there are plenty of good twists throughout as well  it will keep you guessing until the end . other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse . it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don  t let that put you off  you could do a lot worse than checking this out  you won  t regret it . good fun .      
i saw this film at a pre  release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills . as i recall  the film  s producers and director were in attendance  presumably to gage our reaction .  br    br   many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience  which would have been fine if it had been a comedy  but it was supposed to be a horror film .  br    br   if the audience wasn  t scared  it seems the filmmakers were . they delayed release for over a year . out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they  d re  cut it as far as i can tell  they hadn  t . it was the same lousy movie  just a year older .  br    br   it almost qualifies as  so bad  it  s good   but it  s slow  paced and boring .  
a film i expected very little from  and only watched to pass a quiet hour  but what an hour it turned out to be . roll is an excellent if none  too  serious little story of  country  boy  lost  in  the  big  city  makes  good   it is funny throughout  the characters are endearing and the pace is just right .  br    br   toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt  said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams . he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny . watch out for these two .  br    br   highly recommended .  
aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting  this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia . i can  t imagine anyone actually thinking this was a  good movie .   
this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments . i loved the character of matt  and also tiny . they seemed the most engaging and funny characters  and certainly the most interesting . matt is very good  as is his no good cousin   and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy . i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor  eric bana . my personal favourite part was the brothel scene  loved that . overall  i liked the film and it  ll get about an  rating . the penalty however  i was disappointed in . it was a side foot curl  rather than the appropriate laces blast .  br    br   i am of course kidding .    
while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing  the execution is downright pathetic . i  m not even sure where to begin as i  ve got so many problems with this movie . i suppose i  ll just number a few of them  br    br    . the acting  when you see that edward albert  doug mcclure  and susan george  and her teeth  are the stars of your movie  you know you  re in trouble  not that it matters much to me  but these are hardly a  list names . susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy  but i  ve never considered her the greatest actress i  ve ever seen . and in this movie  her acting is embarrassing . as for the other two  the less said the better .  br    br    . the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride . at disney world . and  they are about as frightening . and why did they have to be so obvious  subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells .  br    br    . the plot  how predictable can one movie be  the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters . if you couldn  t see where this movie was headed after about   minutes  you need to see more movies .  br    br    . the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks  not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over  knocks on the door  and asks if you need help removing evil spirits . absurd is a word that comes to mind .  br    br    . everything else  it  s very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about . i suppose i  ll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house  s architecture . that  s a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn  t say much about the actual movie .  br    br   i  ll stop . you should be able to get the idea from what i  ve already mentioned . and  i haven  t even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems . be warned  this thing is horrible .  
plato  s run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey . it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to . gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer  scarface  and action star jeff speaksman  the expert  . what i liked about plato  s run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato  s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato  s run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it  out of    
film starts in     japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide . it  s a very gory  bloody sequence . then it jumps to present day . . . well     to be precise . ted  edward albert   wife laura  susan george  and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby  s work . they rent a house and   surprise  surprise   it just happens to be the house where the murders took place  the three dead people are around as ghosts  the makeup is hysterically bad  and make life hell for the family .  br    br   sounds ok   but it  s really hopeless . there  s a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between . there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious  they look so fake   i swear i saw the strings pulling one along   and they  re muttering      there  s a pointless sex sequence in the first   minutes  probably just to show off george  s body   another one about   minutes later  but that was necessary to the plot  and a really silly exorcism towards the end . the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed .  br    br   as for acting   albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend . but george   as always   is terrific in a lousy film . she gives this film a much needed lift   but can  t save it . i  m giving this a  just for her and the gory opening and closing . that aside  this is a very boring film .  
  a wrong  doer is often a man that has left something undone  not always he that has done something .    emperor marcus aurelius  br    br   the dvd release of  watch on the rhine  could not come at a better moment . it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett  hellman scholar bernard f . dick  s audio commentary affirms his authorship  . it presents a subtle performance by bette davis  who took a subdued secondary role long after she  d become the workhorse queen at the warner bros . lot . equally significantly  it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose .  br    br   sure  you say  like we needed that . we  ve heard cary grant sermonizing in  destination tokyo        about japanese boys and their bushido knives . we  ve watched jackboots stomp the living hills in  the sound of music        . we  ve toured an england callously occupied by germany in  it happened here        . yet  truth to tell  we still need the message spread .  br    br   i have an    year  old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly . he feels that fdr connived the u . s . into a foreign fight we didn  t need  and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin . he  s encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan .  br    br   the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland  europe  or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in     . buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn  t confronted the nazis  drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france  no war would have engulfed the west . he believes that without the rigors of total war  no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem .  br    br   some commenters on this site feel that  watch  sags under the weight of stale propaganda . maybe . however  neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film  s point some people hurt and kill to grab other people  s land  goods  and liberty such people dominated the axis powers and  enough  didn  t appear in their vocabulary .  br    br   paul lukas deserved the oscar he won . he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors . they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines  for actively facing down torturers and murderers . bernard dick notes that hellman didn  t care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical . of course  as a hungarian he had seen first  hand bela kun  s bloody  dictatorship of the proletariat  replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy  s right  wing tyranny .  br    br   in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett  henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves . his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in     during the plot of july   th against hitler . in april      however  he pragmatically abets the nazi cause  although he insults herr blecher  the butcher  and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader .  br    br   teck  a pauper and possible cuckold  wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire  shattering great war and the greater world  wide economic depression . he has no political convictions  no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow . mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt  out case  s old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace .  br    br   lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man  s hostess  a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way   but who doesn  t adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls . she and her pallid office  bound son belong to the american version of von ramme  s and de brancovis  privileged kind . however  this family hasn  t seen ruin and never will . they  re moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it .  br    br   this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan .  watch on the rhine  has a manicured period look . its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets . yet hellman and hammett  s film has gut  based power . audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march .  
that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days .  br    br   first of all  there is such a thing as the art of cinematography . just picking up a   mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie .  br    br   i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn  t pick up someone  s camcorder . . .  br    br   second  indie films are supposed to be about real people . there  s nothing real in this film . none of the characters come across as being even remotely human .  br    br   what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how  cool and edgy  he is .  br    br   sorry  but this is not good writing  or good directing .  br    br   what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance . hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted . . .  br    br   in any case  it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand .  
in     i had just moved to the us from ceylon . i was    and had been married for a little over three years  and was beginning to come out as a lesbian . i saw this movie on an old black and white tv  with terrible reception  alone  and uninterrupted  in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story . i was living in a small house in tucson arizona  and it was summertime . . . like everyone else here  i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth  and its residue of fragile magic  and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday . i  ll keep checking in . i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel  s  the other side of venus  . it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy . . .  
i don  t think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it  s over if you were ever scared . this doesn  t really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn  t tack on one of those happy endings . story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto  japan so that ted fletcher  edward albert  can write a book and he brings along his wife laura  susan george  and their daughter amy  amy barrett  . their friend alex curtis  doug mcclure  who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted . about    years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide . their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher  s arrive it doesn  t take long before strange things start happening .  br    br   spoiler alert  br    br   at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher  s and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair . meanwhile  ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help . unfortunately the ghosts get ted  laura  and alex to play out their death scene like it happened    years earlier .  br    br   this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them . while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked . first  it doesn  t have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons . instead  it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts . secondly  it has susan george in the cast  i  ve always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch . also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn  t have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it  s one of the reasons why she was so popular . but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically . this isn  t a bad film but it  s never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two . the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career .  
the previous reviewer has said it exactly . i saw it once  was enchanted  saw it a second time when it was re  broadcast within a week or two of the first airing . i still remember some of the scenes . the setting is the opening of the   th century  the war referred to in the title is world war i . one of the scenes was set in a women  only section of a public place  which was an interesting historical note . the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all  time great movie moments . i don  t think of this as a  gay movie   it  s an interesting and tender period love story  where the two principals happen to be women . i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd .  
dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a    year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .  br    br   novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell . the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .  br    br   one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned . the monk recounts the history of the house  which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence  and then the film simply cuts away to something else . earlier the monk had offered to help . well  where is the help  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier   try to drive the spirits out of the house  although by this time it  s difficult for the viewers to care .  br    br   there are some  probably  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director  s motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud .  
as with all the other reviewers  this movie has been a constant in my mind after   years . i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story . i even wrote to the pbs station for more information . despite all this  all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the     s .  br    br   fastward to      after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was  a vhs copy of the movie . there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie . the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her . despite owning a copy  i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie . you can find it at http   www . johntopping . com  harvey   perr  war   widow  war  widow . html  
the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads  kushiata kyoto  japan      . a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori  toshiya maruyama  walks up the winding path to the house  inside waits otami  mako hattori  with whom he is having an affair behind her husband  shugoro  s  tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki  back who happens to be masanori  s teacher . shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other . his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide . over a century later and ted fletcher  edward albert  arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura  susan george  and their young daughter amy  amy barrett  . their close friend alex curtis  doug mcclure  who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay  you don  t need me to you where  he jokingly says it  s going so cheap because it  s haunted  to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don  t believe in ghosts  at least for the time being that is . almost immediately the film goes into clich mode . lights turn on and off by themselves  laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk  henry mitowa  gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it  s too late which they ignore  of course . the spirits of otami  masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches  tsuyako olajima  curse put upon them . but there may be a way they can break the curse  unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage  daughter and possibly even their very lives .  br    br   directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film  ok to watch once if you  ve got nothing better to do but after a day or two you  ll probably have completely forgotten it . nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there  s nothing particularly good about the film either . the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by  the  numbers  a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn  t help things . there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter  noriko  mayumi umeda  . and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in  however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in  some exorcism  one more thing  i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was   when he made this  try his hand at kung  fu and oriental sword fighting  george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure  although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present . apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there  s no blood  gore or violence to speak about . the  transparent  ghost effects are ok but they ain  t going to impress many people these days . it  s professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america  england or any western country without having to change a thing . an ok time waster .  
i saw this movie in      my first year of living in new york . i went on to live there for the next   years  but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie . it was part of a pbs series as i recall  and i  ve never forgotten it .  br    br   there are no sex scenes to speak of  just delicate  moving  extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement  all set within a conservative  boston  i think   world war  environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war  and did not seek out a career and financial independence . frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next   odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail .  br    br   there has to be a video of this movie  sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video   
this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don  t take it seriously . it is a bit dated and the effects are lame  but it is so enjoyable . there are giant crabs that attack a girl . oh  and the crabs sing japanese . it is amazingly bad . and the ending  which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome . predictable  but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat . don  t even give this film a chance and you will love it . susan george is fun to watch and yes  she does appear naked . her daughter isn  t quite worth putting up with  but she does get attacked by giant crabs . they are the size of large cats . this is a   but i love it . as a movie  my god  but for entertainment  i give it a  . did i mention there are giant crabs   
almost   years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender . periodically  i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd . it  s september of      and i keep hoping   deep sigh .  br    br   one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime  time evening soap the other  frances lee mccain  was seen in small roles here and there for a few years . but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced  as i recall it  on a short  lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up  and  coming playwrights .  br    br   i watched it every time it was shown on pbs  maybe  or  times . that was before the era of vcrs  so i have no record of it  except in my mind  s eye .  br    br             addition to above happy new year  ladies  this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper . org . my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer  s own personal copy .  
 . . it  s this one  very cool premise  right off the bat .  br    br   has an excellent first scene  gotta give credit where credit  s due .  br    br   has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared  which i really liked by the way how it was done  how it looked . . . the only thing was the ghost  s relationship . because of the way things went down in the first scene you  d think their dynamic would be different .  br    br   things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt  and the crab  spider scene was just not good . but then the ending is actually very good  sure   the grudge  basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai  s and that  s what i liked about this movie comparatively .  br    br   please  someone one with a tempered style remake this movie .  br    br   fans of  silent rage  would absolutely love this movie .  
it  s been a while since i  ve watched this movie  and the series  but now i  m refreshing my memory  this was a very funny movie based on the classic series  johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together . bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee . when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm  bo and luke sneak around hogg  s local construction site and find samples of coal . they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip  mine hazzard county  unless the dukes can stop him  with the help of their beautiful cousin  daisy . my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn  t right for the part of boss hogg  and sheriff rosco p . coltrane was way too serious . other than that  i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard     
at the beginning of the film  you might double  check the dvd cover and re  read the synopsis a couple of times  but no worries . it  s not  memoirs of a geisha  that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be . still  the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie  as it shows how in the year     a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery . he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara  kiri  ritual suicide through disembowelment  . cut to present day  when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago . from then onwards  this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional . let  s start with the good aspects  namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all  time favorite british horror wench  well  together with britt eckland  linda hayden and ingrid pitt  . the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent  imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter . the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff . the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan  s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress  in this  possessed  state  she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests . so  strictly spoken  it  s not really  evil  that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long  dead hands  obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening  especially since the light  blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in  ghostbusters  .  the house where evil dwells  is probably the least scary ghost movie ever . throughout most of the running time  you  ll be wondering whether director kevin connor  who nevertheless made the excellent horror films  motel hell  and  from beyond the grave   intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over  the  top  like  motel hell  maybe . but then again  everyone in the cast continues to speak his  her lines with a straight and sincere face  so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed .  the house where evil dwells  is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn  t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning . i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds  but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights . well  those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over  sized spiders  or are they crabs   in the daughter  s bedroom . how totally random and irrelevant was that  if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation  make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep .  br    br   trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon  mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba .  
what is wrong with you people  if you weren  t blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head . of course the film isn  t a masterpiece  i don  t think it was aiming to be . it was fun and funny  i never watched the show when i was younger  i only recently saw one episode  and when i watched the movie  i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere . the movie seats were practically shaking  and the car sequences were good because it didn  t bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in  fast  furious . and jessica simpson is plain hot  i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences . all in all  i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd . people  enjoy it for what it is .  
this could have been interesting  a japan  set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly  installed american family  but falls flat due to an over  simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director .  br    br   the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare  i . e . the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they  re expected to  besides  it doesn  t deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as  generally  the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way  such as susan george seducing diplomat  friend  of  the  family doug mcclure and edward albert force  feeding his daughter a bowl of soup   br    br   at one point  an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually  he  s called upon to exorcise the premises . however  history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure  possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors  engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death  at the end of the day  this emerges an innocuous time  waster  tolerable at just   minutes but  in no way  essential viewing .  
having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised . reality check the original series wasn  t that good . i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke  s legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted . the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks  the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment . it  s amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series .  br    br   back to the movie . if you watch this film in it  s own right  not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series  then it  s not bad at all . the real star is of course the general lee . the car chases and stunts are excellent and that  s really what d . o . h . is all about . johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb  and  dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved . the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy  burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m . c . gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p . coltrane  the way he always should have been .  br    br   if you don  t like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn  t be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect . otherwise if you want an entertaining car  action movie with a few good laughs that  s not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind .  
giant crabs cursing in japanese  what was in that drink  a terrible movie  but laughable . i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around . drink much beer before you see this movie .  
i  m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show . and i really enjoyed this flick . i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters .  br    br   it  s funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like  lame plot  and  it  s much cruder than the show .  does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode  daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage . the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot .  br    br   and as far as the plot goes . it was the perfect dukes plot . in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen .  br    br   while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren  t exactly like their small screen versions  they do a great job and work very well together . i wasn  t too keen on burt  s boss hogg though . and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe . in the movie roscoe is a little . . . scary .  br    br   and who didn  t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard   br    br   folks  allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia  bikinis and car chases  you won  t be sorry . it  s just a great dumb movie   
from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb  this movie seems to get ragged on a lot  but i didn  t think it was that bad . i  ve seen much worse  actually .  br    br    the house where evil dwells  is a ghost story about a husband and his wife  ted and laura fletcher  and their daughter  amy  who move into an old house in japan . little do they know  a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover  and then killed himself    years earlier with a samurai sword . as strange things happen in the house  the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living  and plan on re  enacting the bloody murder that took place    years back .  br    br   i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance  from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story . it was routine  and it was corny  but i  ve seen worse in my day . the ghost sequences were a little over  done  we get to see the translucent blue  tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family  and take over their bodies . to be honest  the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland . i may be mistaken  but after watching this  it seemed to me that the japanese horror film  ju  on the grudge  and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little . the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place  ghostly activity  curses put on the home  etc . but i may be wrong .  br    br   to sum it up  this is a pretty corny ghost story . don  t go out of your way to see it  but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot .     .  
i saw this movie when i was a child . it blew me away . this was before the days of television  so a movie of this magnitude  could send a young kid into orbit . it so impressed me  that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days . the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its  time . sabu was a real delight  as was rex ingram as the genie . i found myself singing  i want to be a sailor  for months after the film left town . i would recommend this movie to any and everyone . i forgot to mention conrad veidt  who was as villainous a character as you  d ever want to meet . also  june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture . the color was outstanding . give this movie an aaa   
director kevin connor and wannabe action  hero  romantic lead doug mcclure  re  team in this ghost story set in japan . they had been moderately successful together in the      s  with the likes of  the land that time forgot          at the earth  s core        etc . without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though  the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way .  br    br   the film begins with a prologue set in the   th century  with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide . a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted  laura  visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place .  br    br   no surprises as to what happens next  with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex  mcclure  assuming the role of the wife  s lover .  br    br   everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant  to an inevitable  but surprisingly downbeat  conclusion . main points of interest are two feeble decapitations   the omen  has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set  piece   and the love  making scenes featuring the doe  eyed but extremely kinky susan george . the first is a long  don  t look now  inspired piece with her hubby  complete with piano music the second a much shorter  probably at her insistence  entanglement with mcclure  both looking pretty uncomfortable . anyway  every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost .  br    br   overall i can  t decide whether  the house where evil dwells  is rubbish  watchable rubbish  or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way . if you  re not into the genre there is nothing here at all  but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort .  br    br   best scene  in any other film the big  black  tree  climbing  japanese  muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show . they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene  where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup . on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is        to be told beef and vegetable  before uttering the immortal line  ugh  there  s an awful face in my soup  . if this wasn  t enough the reply is  c  mon  eat your soup for daddy .  laurel  hardy rest in piece .  
loved the movie . i even liked most of the actors in it . but  for me ms . davis  very poor attempt at an accent  and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch . seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms . davis they would be laughed off the screen .  br    br   i really think she  phoned this one in  . now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more .  br    br   i guess i just don  t  get  bette davis . i  ve always thought of her as an actor that  plays herself  no matter what role she  s in . the possible exception is now voyager .  br    br   i  m sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful  and i hope civil  detail how i am totally wrong on this . but  i  ll continue to watch the movies she  s in because i like the stories  writing  supporting casts  but  i  ll always be thinking  of different actresses that could have done a better job .  
raising victor vargas is just a bad film . no amount of denial or ad  dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact .  br    br   maybe peter sollett saw he didn  t have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current  edgy film  making  . maybe he just doesn  t know any better . it  s hard to tell .  br    br   what  s not hard to tell is the result . except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film  making into an attempt at pseudo  realism  few will enjoy it .  br    br   i know i didn  t .  br    br   do yourselves a favor and pass on this film .  
next to  star wars  and  the wizard of oz   this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made . it  s a true shame it  s not as well  known as the former films  maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci  fi settings  and that it  s british  meaning a smaller market for films  but its wonderful to know that it  s deserved that reputation .  br    br   like all great family films  one can be a child  an adult  or even a teenager to enjoy this film  i  m currently     but one must appreciate classic films first . i absolutely adore this film . it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa  perhaps my favorite classic film score  that rivals any john williams  star wars  score  a fast but not flashy pace  beautiful sets  dialog  and use of color  both the sets and cinematography won oscars   and state  of  the  art oscar  winning special effects  for the time  and some are still stunning  . and  of course  june duprez  s sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta  jones   she even looks like jones in a way   .  br    br   in conclusion  this is one of my all  time favorite movie  next to  the adventures of robin hood   and it truly deserves more attention . it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout  and  along with  robin hood   it  s my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed .  br    br   stars   excellent   
i just rented and watched this movie just to see what  s all the fuss about . so here  s what my reactions to it are . it  s easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors . the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists . this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film . however  the movie doesn  t shock or disturb me at all . it just bored me . this movie could be easily shortened to under   minutes . all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time  like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below .  br    br   contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame . i don  t know if i have watched the cut or uncut version  if there is actually such a version . i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot . here  s a list on top of my mind .  br    br   why don  t the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are . that would be an excellent time .  br    br   why don  t they just gang rape her  instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer  s ordeal by such a long time . it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way .  br    br   i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house . maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles .  br    br   these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right  they shouldn  t send a coward imbecile to do the job .  br    br   why didn  t jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left  which should be the first thing that pops up in most people  s mind  especially for someone who is a writer .  br    br   why didn  t these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive   br    br   i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him . ends spoiler  br    br   but hey  this movie is not without its merits  camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer  why me  why me  i didn  t even cm      
it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages   to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful  colorful production  and  to adults  for a literate script  fine production values  good casting  acting  all bound together with a fine rozsa score . two roughly contemporary films accomplish this    thief of baghdad        and  the adventures of robin hood        . some of the back story on this production is fascinating . this production  commenced in england in the summer of      moved to hollywood  and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts  the producer  alexander korda  was subsequently knighted in     . here is a unique case of the intersection of art  commerce  and politics  by all means  secure a good cd of this film for your library   
i  ve seen the gator bait films  and this is almost exactly the same thing as those . a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them . the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones  although not very far  is that the sexual content is not glorified . there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film  but not for a second is it ever sexy . some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive  but that  s only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience  s need to see this woman seek revenge .  br    br   this is a weak film  it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers . i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral  but i was glad to see that  since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead  it was not meant to pass off as a ta film .  br    br   b  movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality  and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b  movie and contains more than its share of nudity  the nudity does not drive the plot . on the other hand  the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists . these men are evolutionary drop  outs just like they were in the gator bait films  and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them  but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b  movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind  but instead it simply satisfies the audience  s desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve .  br    br   the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks . oddly  the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity  although not by much   but it is by far the most painful to watch . we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible  it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller  staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord   but again  this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with .  br    br    spoilers  you know that this is all the movie means to do  since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed . the woman does not live happily ever after  she doesn  t write her book  she doesn  t leave and never return to that nightmare place  she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks . but hey  what more did you expect   br    br   oh  and did you read the tagline  if you decide to waste your time watching this  try and find any man getting broken or burned . i was really looking forward to those  
this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure . the genii in the bottle is a classic scene . romantic in it  s finish  all things turn out as they should be . i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true .  
i  m not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there  s almost no plot  anyway . i  ve seen several reviewers call isoyg an  anti  rape  film or even a feminist statement  and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims .  br    br   first of all  what do we see on the cover of this movie  that  s right a shapely woman  s behind . whether it was zarchi  s attempt to make an anti  rape statement  and i absolutely don  t believe it was  is entirely beside the point . the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic  everything but actual penetration is shown  that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it .  br    br   the rape  s  in the film is uncomfortable  brutal and hard to watch . there  s something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light  but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly   minutes  none . there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed  mere moments before he  s murdered  so the scene isn  t at all engaging on an emotional level . really  it  s just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb  caligula  cannibal ferox  etc .  that it attracts only the exploitation crowd .  br    br   finally  a few reviewers have commended zarchi  s so  called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack . but considering how inept everything else in the film is  acting  script  etc .  i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn  caliber actors do their thing .  br    br   i  m not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg . i  m all for exploitation  horror and love video nasties . in fact  i  m giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films . however  it  s also poorly made and after the rape occurs  just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho  hum  mostly gore  less murders and wait for the credits to roll .  br    br   this is probably worth watching once if you  re a hardcore   s exploitation fan but i  m telling you  the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation .  
let  s cut a long story short . i loved every minute of it . a lavish fantasy in true arabian  nights style . there  s an evil magician  a pretty princess  a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after . modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic . only quibble the special effects are pretty dated  loved sabu with the djinn  s foot  though    
okay  you have  br    br   penelope keith as miss herringbone  tweed  b . b . e .  backbone of england .  she  s killed off in the first scene  that  s right  folks this show has no backbone   br    br   peter o  toole as ol  colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor .  br    br   joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor    years younger than the colonel and   years past her own prime but still glamourous  brit spelling  not mine  enough to have a toy  boy on the side . it  s alright  they have col . cricket  s full knowledge and consent  they guy even comes  round for christmas   still  she  s considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy  boy her own age  what a gal    br    br   david mccallum as said toy  boy  equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze . pilcher couldn  t come up with any cover for him within the story  so she gave him a hush  hush job at the circus .  br    br   and finally  br    br   susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups  venerable headmistress of the venerable girls  boarding  school  serving tea in her office with a dash of deep  poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation . her best bit of advice  i  ve only been to nancherrow  the local stately home of england  once . i thought it was very beautiful but  somehow  not part of the real world .  well  we can  t say they didn  t warn us .  br    br   ah  susan  time was  your character would have been running the whole show . they don  t write  em like that any more . our loss  not yours .  br    br   so  with a cast and setting like this  you have the re  makings of  brideshead revisited   right   br    br   wrong  they took these   dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well . after all  acting is one of the oldest temp  jobs there is  you name another    br    br   first warning sign lots and lots of backlighting . they get around it by shooting outdoors   hey  it  s just the sunlight    br    br   second warning sign leading lady cries a lot . when not crying  her eyes are moist . that  s the law of romance novels leading lady is  dewy  eyed .   br    br   henceforth  leading lady shall be known as l . l .  br    br   third warning sign l . l . actually has stars in her eyes when she  s in love . still  i  ll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes  i wonder . did they use contacts    br    br   and lastly  fourth warning sign no on  screen female character is  mrs .  she  s either  miss  or  lady .   br    br   when all was said and done  i still couldn  t tell you who was pursuing whom and why . i couldn  t even tell you what was said and done .  br    br   to sum up they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all .  br    br   ok  at the end  l . l . finds she  s lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic . meanwhile  there  s always a  meanwhile    some young guy l . l . had a crush on  when  i don  t know  comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor  must be some street if she  s going to find him there .  both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow  somebody has to be  whisked away  somewhere in these romance stories    br    br   great drama .  
a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell . these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece  some of the most ravishing early technicolor  a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu  the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well . miles malleson who plays duprez father  the sultan of basra  also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose . don  t miss this one  since posting the above comments  i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i  d never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version  the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned  this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer . again  a must see   
with knightly and o  tool as the leads  this film had good possibilities  and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly  maybe some tension . but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants . it was of course totally superficial  beautiful english country and seaside or not . the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film  when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older  instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part . they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast  and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low  cost heartstring elements .  
a fantastic arabian adventure . a former king  ahmad  and his best friend  the thief abu  played by sabu of black narcissus  search for ahmad  s love interest  who has been stolen by the new king  jaffar  conrad veidt  . there  s hardly a down moment here . it  s always inventing new adventures for the heroes . personally  i found ahmad and his princess a little boring  there  s no need to ask why john justin  who plays ahmad  is listed fourth in the credits  . conrad veidt  always a fun actor  makes a great villain  and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves  who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra  the father of the princess . he collects amazing toys from around the world . jaffar bribes him for his daughter  s hand with a mechanical flying horse . this probably would count as one of the great children  s films of all time  but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together . and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time  willis o  brien  s stop  motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn  t even look remotely like a spider .     .  
quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom .  br    br   a group of top quality actors  in the main well cast  with a couple of notable exceptions   who give pretty good performances . penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana . all do well with the scripts they were given .  br    br   so much for the good . the average would include the sets . nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book  although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it . it is clear then that the dower house is far too big . in the later parts  the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk  presumably to save money  although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon .  br    br   now to the bad . the screenplay . this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it . edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives  blinded . he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide  why   loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer  s wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear  less emotional than brief encounter  . gus  a man besotted and passionately in love  is prepared to give up his love without complaint . walter  mudge in the book  turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man . jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won  t speak . aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification . the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers . whilst miss mortimer  s breasts are utterly delightful  i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward . the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson . the word limit prevents me from continuing the list .  br    br   there is a sequel  which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense  and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story . it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased .  
this was usually producer alexander korda  s advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex  zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out  pushing it to six .  br    br   for john kobal  s     book   the top    movies   his survey of   film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach   th place . a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner  john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture  but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half  way mark .  br    br   the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie  s production shifted around england and america  eventually seeing completion in     and winning three technical oscars . like citizen kane  it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love .  br    br   the special effects  outstanding for the time  are still reasonable  and actually hold up if you squint . but it  s not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions . among them is an amusing horse  constructed out of a kit model  which  when a key is inserted up it  s rear end  begins to fly . there  s also a killer toy of the six  armed goddess kali   perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her  and a quite horrific  looking giant spider . also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet . but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as  in a superb moment of cinematic conceit  a djinn  genie  nearly a thousand feet tall  ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature  and adds an element of danger to the proceedings . and look out for the moment where he  s tricked back into his bottle   br    br   john justin does well as the arabic king who  for some strange reason  has an english accent and a stiff upper lip . sabu  the astonishingly muscled   year  old  is near  namesake abu  a likeably cocky thief . after they cross paths with the evil jaffer  conrad veidt   justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog . when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed  s  justin  s  perspective  we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues . in truth  the second half is someway the better  being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature .  br    br   three small songs pepper the piece  though as the film lasts for    minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldn  t classify this as a musical . it  s all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads  veidt is the boo  hiss villain  and abu is the youthful  irrepressible robber . it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of   s english movies  but once you  ve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in . quite commendable .  
being a filmmaker myself  and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour  i thought i was in for a treat when i took home  my wrongs . . .   not that the dvd cover gives anything away  instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director  chris morris   a short film including scenes   . i should have known better really  and avoided this insipid  and often offensive  piece of twoddle .  br    br   the scene in the church is repulsive to watch  especially since we are all too familiar with morris  s warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series  brass eye  and serves no purpose other than to shock . how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand .  br    br   the runner  s commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle  having been a runner myself  it  s often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process   however this is sadly not the case here . instead  we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film  before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs . this is all very interesting  but not worth a single frame of celluloid .  br    br   to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement . it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style  at the expense of plot  character and dialogue  leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled . its over  simplified message  that man should take responsibility for his actions  is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated .  br    br   the film does have its moments of pseudo  kafkaesque surrealism  but ultimately  it fails to convince  to entertain  to enlighten and just ends up being irritating . if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking  i strongly recommend  franz kafka  s it  s a wonderful life   by peter capaldi .  
the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself  almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film . alexander korda nearly went broke making this film .  br    br   according to the citadel film series book about the great british films  adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as     and spent years of planning and preparation . but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle .  br    br   budget costs happen in us films too  only cecil b . demille always had a free hand at paramount after     when he returned there . but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film . part of the way through the shoot  korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon . he certainly wasn  t going to get scenery like that in the uk . korda also finished the interiors in hollywood  all in time for a release on christmas day     .  br    br   the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography  best artset direction for a color film  and best special effects . only miklos rosza  s original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category . korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it  s impossible to get bad color pictures from that place .  br    br   the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil . the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart  both belonging to duprez . this was veidt  s career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser .  br    br   of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source . beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star . literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features . sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant . not a bad message to be sending out in     at that .  br    br   the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today . it  s an eternal tale of love  romance  and adventure in any order you want to put it .  
simply not the quality i expected from morris  love brass eye and blue jam  . this is very much like a not so bad student film . what concerns me  in all this is why did it win a bafta    morris makes fun of  enshrined mediocrity   ayn rand  in much of his work  nathan barley  and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining   br    br   i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle  the humanity of terrorism  four lions  that he isn  t going to cock that up  wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena .  
although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special .  br    br   if you  ve never seen this film before you  ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers . i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney  s aladdin cribbed from the film . they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers .  br    br   i  ve given the film an  out of   instead of a   out of ten  which is where a good portion of this film dwells  because in the final   minutes the film falls apart in the pacing . everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end . from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting . it doesn  t kill the film  but it does weaken it .  br    br   still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale  or even a great movie .  
there  s nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets . it  s just that some are better than others . this is very poor . the acting is awful  the script dire and the special effects overrated .  br    br   why does hollywood treat it  s audience with such contempt  and why have they made a sequel   
this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i  m grown up and have a kid of my own  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday  and he liked it . during abu  s fight with the giant spider  my son  s hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared .  is he gonna beat the spider  poppa   just watch  you  ll see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  eight years old   so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al  raschid might as well be oz under ozma .  br    br   i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring  do were perpetrated by the boy  thief  and not the grown  up king . in fact  if you deconstruct the film  s narrative a bit  the king is the thief  s sidekick  not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative  adventurous young boys .  br    br   it  s definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time he  s eleven or twelve  my son will find it  corny  or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one  dimensional  as a cynical friend commented   why does ahmad love the princess  because the narrative demands it .  the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  repeatedly  for the clueless  love  struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses  fifty  foot genies and the temple of the all  seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie  s climax is tremendous  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  stolen  magic carpet  seeking  some fun  and adventure at last    
one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying  it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked . one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they  the yuppies  are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art . while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning  i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner . if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home  i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies .  
i have seen this film several times  and watched it today  on tcm  solely because of geraldine fitzgerald . she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her  probably in  wuthering heights    or more years ago  . the real star in this movie  however  is paul lukas  and he deserved all the accolades he got . he makes it clear  whether we like it or not  that the end justifies the means . naziism had to be stopped  and anything that helped do it was good . he gave his children a line about being bad  and that they should not be bad  but as he said earlier when conversing with adults  he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation . lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation  and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do .  br    br   some people think his victim was a nazi  but i don  t think so  i think he was only after the money . his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him .  br    br   one interesting point in the film  and presumably also in the play  is the fact that muller  lucas  is a german . while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii  there was considerable anti  german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry . it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time  maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi  soviet pact   . after all  the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians . i think  however  that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later  after  watch on the rhine  was released .  br    br   the title is something of a play on words  as the  watch  is looking west  from germany . in fact  watch am rhein was a german army marching song  used in wwii  but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well . but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own  wach am rhein  .  br    br   all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him . i am surprised he did not give his father  s secret away . in real life  he may very well have done so .  
this  film  is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen .  br    br   please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction .  br    br   shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as  direction   which this film needed in droves . not that the writing was all the wonderful  rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way  the pseudo  documentary  style  prized by those who don  t know how to direct  .  br    br   this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don  t know the first thing about film  making  which is most of them  .  br    br   just terrible . it says a lot about sundance and what it  s become that victor vargas was showcased there .  
when i read other comment  i decided to watch this movie . . .  br    br   first  cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough . . .  br    br   film  very intelligence and interesting because  cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia . . .  br    br   second  story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you  ll like in my opinion . . .  br    br   third  final chapter is not special or interesting  it  s regular like other action movies . . .  br    br   finally  i recommend to watch this movie . . . and i hope you  ll love it enjoy d  
without wishing to be a killjoy  brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films i  ve ever seen  this being one of them  and camp blood being another .  br    br   the acting is terrible  the print is shoddy  and everything about this film screams  seriously  you could do better yourself  . maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap   br    br   i bought this for    but remember  you can  t put a price on   minutes of your life . you  d do well to avoid this turkey  even at a bargain basement price .  
probably the finest fantasy film ever made . sumptuous colour  spectacular sets  incredible  spot  on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood . acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands  but here the poetic dialog is deftly  sensitively spoken  the humour is subtle and delightful as well  .  br    br   doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one . along with  the four feathers         one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films    and one of the finest motion pictures ever made .  br    br   a true  compelling classic   
enough is enough . . . sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead . the first tremors movie was great . the second one was ridiculous . the third one was nauseating . the tv series was depressingly awful . and this movie just drives the stake deeper .  br    br   basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry  now we have the series set in the wild west  in the      s  and they fight graboids . like a rehash of the first one  they have to learn how to beat them all over again . mildly entertaining i suppose . otherwise this straight  to  video release  just like tremors  and   is just going way too far . oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place . . . did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event  i think something like this would be history  making  so our pals in the first film wouldn  t be so unprepared .  br    br   movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy . avoid this garbage .  
words can hardly describe it  so i  ll be brief .  the thief of bagdad  was my favorite movie as a child  and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me . i loved this film from the first moment i saw it  when i was a boy of six who had started reading  the arabian nights .  i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu  s battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled .  br    br   rarely has so much beauty  magic  and wonder been captured on film . sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros  conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar  and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie . georges perinal  s photography is some of the best use of technicolor . one of the three credited directors is michael powell  a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films  including  a matter of life and death   aka  stairway to heaven   and  the red shoes .  he is one of the true masters of the camera  right up there with david lean  akira kurosawa  and orson welles .  br    br   as with all great works of art  the beauty of  the thief of bagdad  lies in the detail . every frame has its own magical charm . the story never lags  and the characters and their actions are always involving . here is a film that will never grow old .  
dear dear dear dear dear . . . me  i had the strength to see it through . . . but why    br    br   the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good . but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing . this was some kind of tremors for kids . i can  t believe this movie was made at all . . seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind  for kids  and they just did whatever they could with it .  br    br   what audience is this movie for  i can only think of      year olds . if you  re older than   you  ll have serious problems with this movie . it  s not only slow  but it  s so utterly boring . the characters are overacted  not just a little either  and so stereotyped it  s fun for a while . . but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen . you know everything that is going to happen too  cause yes . . . you  ve seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids . i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced . it  s so bad . . so wrong . . so . . . crap .  br    br   but ok  we did get a laugh now and then . not just at the silly plot holes  but some scenes where worth a replay or two . . . or one scene that is  where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys . . it  s really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly . still makes me grin when i think about it . but that only happened one more time sadly . . and that  s when the  badass  gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully . . . that and one comment  they spring from the ground like some demonic trout   at this point we where almost crying with laughter . but after that . . nothing could ever top that . .    . . so it  s pretty much downhill from there .  br    br   so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting . if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie . . . he  s either a  plant   vegetable or someone very evil . this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far . looking forward to seeing tremors   it  s bound to be box office hit compared to this . . . this . . . goosebumps no . . i  ll leave it at that .  
i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess . as any kid would be  i was delighted with the imagination  inventiveness and energy of the film . several years later  i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing . i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years . in addition to the script  the production transcends the fantasy genre . this is korda  the storyteller at his very best . when you see thief as a child you know that youve had a great time . when you see thief as an adult you know that youve seen a masterpiece . its as timeless as the story it treats . an amazing work .  br    br   thomas mccarthy  
well . . . tremors i  the original started off in     and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch . however  they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii . trust me  those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one  i mean  ass blasters    now  only god himself is capable of answering the question  why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie   tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie  in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie  for it lives up to more than that . as i attempted to sit though it  i noticed that my eyes started to bleed  and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me . did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we  re from the wild west would make the movie  with the exact same occurrences  any better  honestly  i would never suggest buying this movie  i mean  there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well .  
this is an oriental fantasy about thousand and one arabian nights plenty of incredible adventures  fantasy witchery and wizardly . the malignant vizier jaffar  magnificently played by conrad veidt  with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince ahamad of bagdad  attractive john justin  who loses his throne  then he escapes thanks a little thief named abu  sympathetic sabu  . they arrive basora where ahamad and the princess  gorgeous june duprez  fall in love . but prince and thief are haunted by jaffar  ahamd is turned blind and abu is become a dog . the story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring  a flying mechanic horse  magic bow  flying carpet and of course the colossal genie  overacting performed by rex ingram  who gives three wishes to sabu  the magic eye  the figure of goddess kali with several hands  among others .  br    br   this remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time . produced by london fim  s alexander korda and directed by the definitively credited ludwing berger  michael powell and tim whelan with a stunning screenplay by lajos biro and miles malleson also dialogs writer and actor as sultan fond to mechanic games . the wwii outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting  then the three korda brothers and collaborators traveled usa continuing there the filming in especial on grand cannon colorado . the splendid visual and glimmer technicolor cinematography  setting and fx provoked the achieving three oscars  production design by william cameron menzies and vincent korda  cinematography by george perinal and special effects by osmond borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn  out . furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by miklos rozsa . this vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs  
just a few words . . . . this movie really sucks . it  s like those tv movies with bad cast and plot . it  s amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii . don  t waste your time watching this crap  even if you like the tremors movies .  
despite having  different directors  this fantasy hangs together remarkably well .  br    br   it was filmed in england  nowhere near morocco  in studios and on a few beaches . at the outbreak of war  everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon .  br    br   notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song   i want to be a bandit  can  t you understand it  . it remains a favourite of many people .  
this  the direct  to  video death rattle of the tremors series  features sixty inspired seconds  sawblade you  ll know it when you see it  and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at . tremors  was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget . that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm  on  human violence  tops . the lackluster  cliche  spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors  experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long . only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through  much less enjoy this film . if you aren  t among them  don  t bother .  
this film  was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that  unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it  s quality while i grew up . this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children  it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well . the only drawback there is  is that one can not see past the bad  effects  compared to the effects nowadays  like one could when one was a child . i remembered nothing of those effects  of course it had been about ten years since i  d seen this film  when i was about eleven years old . who then watches effects  one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides . in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the   th century . coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film . there is comedy  romance and adventure all in one  which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern  it succeeds in not being dusty and old . all of that is mainly due to the great story  the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors . in that department sabu  as abu  and conrad veidt  as jaffar  stand out  providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part . great film and although an  oldie   definitely a goldie  . i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday .  br    br    out of    
the fourth  tremors  feature goes back in time  to the year     .  the legend begins  in the small city of  perfection   which was then  rejection  nevada  . as the story begins  seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly  graboids  . some of the characters in the present  day  tremors  films have ancestors  both figurative and literal  in the past . most obvious is the ever  returning michael gross  as hiram gummer  . unlike his descendant  mr . gross is inept with firearms so  he hires gunslinger billy drago  as  black hand  kelly  to shoot  em up some  dirt dragons  .  br    br   this one takes some getting used to  as it takes place in the distant past . it  s like a western with miniature versions of the original film  s monster  graboids  . these tamer  dirt dragons  are nowhere near as terrorizing as their  tremors        counterparts . consequently  in this film  the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground  which would not have happened in the original movie . and  it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly  when gross temporarily decides to leave town . why so helpless  why didn  t brent roam  as juan pedilla  immediately rally the people to fight without gross  disappointing .  br    br    tremors   the legend begins       s . s . wilson  michael gross  brent roam  billy drago  
abu  the thief of bagdad  helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer .  br    br   as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames  sir alexander korda  s london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights . replete with swords  sorcery  it gave audiences in     a short respite from the headlines . it also is a fine piece of film making  featuring good acting and an intelligent script .  br    br   conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it  playing the evil magician jaffar . his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days . here is a villain worth watching . as the boyish thief  sabu is perfectly cast in this  his third film . while not a hero in the typical sense of the word  his character is certainly heroic in deed  action .  br    br   the rest of the cast do fine work . john justin is both energetic  sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way sabu gets a significant part of the action  when he  s not transformed into a dog  but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must . lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra  coveted by two very different men . appearing late in the film  massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude .  br    br   allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller . miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra  forever dithering on about his mechanical toys  malleson was also responsible for the film  s screen play  dialogue  . aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend . mary morris  later an exceptional stage actress  plays the dual roles of jaffar  s accomplice and the six  armed silver dancer .  br    br   the film was begun in britain  but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california  which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast . the art direction  in vibrant technicolor  is most attractive  especially the fairy tale architecture in blues  whites  pinks .  br    br     br    br   born sabu dastagir in      sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore  s stables when he was discovered by korda  s company and set before the cameras . his first four films  elephant boy       the drum       the thief of bagdad       jungle book       were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed . after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career  but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films  black narcissus       being the one great exception . his final movie  walt disney  s a tiger walks       was an improvement  but it was too late . sabu had died of a heart attack in late      only   years of age .  
warning this review contains minor spoilers .  br    br   well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas . i  m a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare . tremors   the legends begins  however  is a very dull movie . where the heck are the graboids     br    br   due to the relative lack of graboids through the first   minutes i  m convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a  character study  . unfortunately there isn  t one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago  s character who is given too few lines  too little to do and in the end too little screen time . what saved the  nd and  rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer . whenever there wasn  t any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and  or watch . however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute .  br    br   on the plus side when the graboids  dirt dragons in this movie  are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets .  br    br   i was impressed when i saw that tremors  was listed at    minutes long . pretty good for straight to video . but after watching it i  m sure that this movie is a good   minutes too long . there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn  t further the plot any . was there a rush to get this movie made  i think not  more time could have and should have been spent on the script .  br    br   i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors  packaged for sale with . . . . tremors    what luck i thought  pay for   get   for free . well after watching tremors  i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free  i can  t imagine paying a single dime for tremors  . for fans of the series it  s best to forget that tremors   the legend begins even exists .  br    br   tremors   the legend begins rates a  out of   .  
the story  line of  the thief of bagdad  is complex  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together . the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points . the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas . he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar  s deeds and hate him . he is imprisoned by jaffar  where he meets abu the young thief . the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra . there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by . ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden . he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss . then he is captured . when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog . jaffar then asks for the princess  s hand  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra . the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace  accompanied by abu as his dog . the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her . so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog  in hopes the prince can rouse her . he does awaken her . she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard . she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms  on his promise to restore ahmad  s sight and turn abu back into a thief . the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island . abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle . abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel  then corks him in again . for freeing him  he gets three wishes . his first is for sausages . in the meanwhile  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy  one of whose six arms stabs him to death . abu makes a second wish  to find ahmad . the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all  seeing eye . abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye  battling a giant spider  then scaling the goddess  s statue . abu gazes into the  eye  and sees ahmad in a canyon . he has the genie take him to ahmad . ahmad uses the eye to see the princess . she smells a flower and forgets everything at once . abu wishes they were in bagdad  but the genie laughs and leaves jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him  omitting mention of ahmad . ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess  but jaffar smashes the  eye  . abu finds himself in the  land of legend   where the old men who rule want to make him their king . he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess . the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner  using his bow from the flying carpet  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution . jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse  but another shot from the bow finishes him . ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess but when he tries to make abu his vizier  the young thief refuses  saying that what he wants is adventure  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be . this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda . the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography . the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell  with tim whelan  alexander korda  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating . the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong  oliver messel and marcel vertes . the production  apart from its gorgeous and expensive  looking visual splendors  i claim is dominated by two other elements  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar . rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent  plus his usual intelligence and power . june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan . as ahmad  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role . this film has a spaciousness about it that is found  i assert  in other korda works also . its imaginative content stands in contrast to very  strong realistic sets  costumes and set  design elements . this is one of the most memorable idea  level fantasies of all time  worthy to be enjoyed over and over .  
i found tremors  the legend begins  to be dull and boring . all the action scenes were stupid . the so called  graboids  are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat  if not smaller . the acting was horrendous  and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga  because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed  the story is so dumb and useless . also  if you want to tell a story way back in time  make sure you use the same actor  michael gross   to be someone in the past  when he  s someone in the present in the other tremor movies . geez . . . if you haven  t seen this film  don  t waste your time . stick to tremors      and   for a good time . this film however  make sure you  re remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense .  
i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once . the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious  you sons of a thousand fleas  .  br    br   it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about     am once and it had just started . tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work .  br    br         
if fassbinder has made a worse film  i sure don  t want to see it  anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this  to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like  the bitter tears of petra von kant  . this film bogs down with so much arty  quasi  symbolic images it looks like a parody of an  art  film  . the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira  s prostitute friend channel  surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer  s endurance . but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex  wife and  or her daughter . these are the only moments that display any real human emotion  and prove that at the core of this horrible film  there was an excellent film struggling to free itself . what a waste .  
  the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful  but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad . the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with  but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her . jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog . this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa  restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess . during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds  a giant spider that  s really hungry  and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen .  br    br    this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses  genies  flying carpets  and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs . it doesn  t have any cheesy moments and the love story isn  t a waste of time . the production designs are just stunning in this movie . from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter . even though this movie is over   years old  the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today  s cinema . the music and songs are also well done . anyone who sees it will no doubt hail   i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas  as one of the great musical moments in movies . i  m usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i  ll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie .  br    br    what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don  t see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like  two towers  and  silent hill  . way before today  s modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place . one of my favorite shots in  two towers  is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates  the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor  and that  s what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie . they  re just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they  re all just fantasy beings .  br    br    it  s literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of  aladdin  got their inspiration . the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet . it  s not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it  s nice to know that i  m not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie . i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it  s amazing . that  s a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time . sure  the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the    s so give it a break . not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today  s standard .  br    br    if you ever wanted to see a live action version of  aladdin  then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won  t be their cup of tea .  
as if the storyline wasn  t depressing enough  this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher . weird stuff . then there  s the core premise of the hero  heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he  s besot  ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl . is this person a psycho  a masochist  just a doomed queen who takes things too far  and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have  just that he didn  t get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly . he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did  but it  s really really so hard to empathize . such sad and unusual self destruction . was it supposed to be funny  what was it all about really   
outstanding film of     with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened .  br    br   the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of     .  br    br   encounting treachery around them  lukas successfully deals with the situation . he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does .  br    br   davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn  like shedding of tears when they must part . resolute  she knows that her older son  must follow him on his path to liberty .  br    br   a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe .  
i can  t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of   it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring  certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long  long time .  br    br   in a no  budget way  it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck .  br    br   this film should be avoided at all costs . it  s one of those  festival films  that only please the pseudo  intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it  different   therefore good .  br    br   bad film  making is not  different   it  s just bad film  making .  
the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all  time favorite movies . it is exciting without gore  it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless . the casting couldn  t have been better . rex ingram made me believe in genies . and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar . he set the bar very high .  br    br   . . i watch this movie at least twice a year . . . and never tire of it . this film is an adventure for all ages . . no  one too old to enjoy it . the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time . . . i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u . s . was just about to enter wwii . conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying  evilness  a few years later in  casablanca .  and korda teamed up  i believe  with justin and dupree again in  the four feathers  . . . . great film  making   
this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues . that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it .  br    br   i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin  elvira suicides at the end  but instead of this  in every scene somebody is trying to explain  when he was young  this happened . . .  and  he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there . . .   etc .  br    br   soon in the movie  erwin  elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute  certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat   and while telling her the story of elvira  s life  fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other . it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying . of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of  i have suffered much in my life  and am about to die  .  br    br   in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something  erwin  elvira encounters a former lover  that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys  as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality  is that he recognizes elvira .  br    br   there are some interesting shots and ideas  i must admit  such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin   but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder  s self  indulgence .  
an utterly beautiful film  one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do  in thief  s case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time . by the     s my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art  house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa  s stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again .  br    br   idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out  but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne . after escaping with a little thief played by sabu  ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures  although apparently not enough for sabu   and love not only conquers but annihilates everything . the special effects must have been mesmerising in      but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from   years later . anyway  if i  m requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies  flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects  favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall  s suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact  the stunning colours throughout sabu and rozsa  s triumphant but still wistful finale . conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever  this and casablanca  and then died . john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers  both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted  but the parts didn  t call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered .  br    br   there  s a couple of mildly violent images in it  but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a     positive message  it  s only a pity that nowadays little kids don  t watch this instead of the porn they prefer . one of my top   film favourites  i can  t recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time .  
it  s funny . i  ve seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting  while others are repellent and self  indulgent messes   like this film . for me  it ranges from great to crap   without much in the middle . i know he has a lot of fans among the  sophisticated   but i can  t help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype . from my point of view  and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this   he made too many movies too quickly and was too self  indulgent . his gay or gender  bending films  like this one  tend to be really bad   sloppily done  sometimes quite boring  such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant  and sometimes just gross  like this film  . couldn  t his message about acceptance of a person  s gender  confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered  show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic   then  maybe  i  d care about the films .  br    br   i  m honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films   the bad seems to be out  weighing the good .  
the thief of bagdad is a treasure . first and foremost  it is a good story . though my four children  s primary exposure to this tale  the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights  comes from the disney corporation  the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end . the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability . sabu  who plays the young thief  abu  also measures up to any of today  s teen actors in appeal  judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say   he  s c  u  t  e    br    br   in      the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects . today  of course  those effects seem very dated   look  it  s barbie flying through the air   declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying  . yet they fit into the story well . the film is  after all  over   years old . the effects fit with the script . furthermore  what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state  of  the  art for the next twenty  five years . one need only compare the opening montage from a     star trek episode to see this . in that  it was quite an achievement .  br    br   this qualifies as a family film  though there are a few stabbings near the end . the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation .  br    br   all in all  a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment  or for the historical value of the effects . i recommend it .  
this film is in the mandingo  drum type  br    br   they were both dreadful but they are     better than this tripe   br    br   badly acted  made oliver reed is the main name  eartha kitt also is in it . tis a pity . rating is     about as low as yu can get  br    br   as always  br    br   jay harris  
i grew up with this as my all  time favorite film . the special effects are incredible for the era  and won awards . i can remember the dialogue as if i  d heard it yesterday . it is simply a great  timeless adventure . the music is by miklos rosza  who is cinema history  s best . sabu is the thief . conrad veidt is the grand villain . i have a copy within reach  for the next trip down memory lane . whoa there  rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle   
there are no reasons to watch this movie . should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life  s every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill  like that would ever happen  then get this movie from the video shop  if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie . be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone  in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing  . oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk  go figure . but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie  claudia udy showing her chest  sadly no other reason than that   
i first discovered alexander korda  s       fantasy  the thief of bagdad in the early      s on a re  issue billed as  the wonder show of the century   both korda technicolor films  the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program . the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films . the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful  the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made . as the years passed  it became more difficult to enjoy the film  s color in the way it had originally been presented in . true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle      s . both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video . but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor . the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it   nice  but not as it should be . now comes the m  g  m dvd   dec      issue . the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning    it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once  i watched it a second time . the only  extras  are a spanish dubbed version  sub  titles in both english  spanish  and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer . thank you m  g  m for this exceptional dvd release . now  one can only hope that korda  s four feathers and a restored version of korda  s jungle book  to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation  will soon follow on dvd .  
this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the  seinfeld  show  patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he  s noticeably slimmer here . oliver reed got top billing but he  s hardly in the film at all . warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him . eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they  re is so much nudity in the film . if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they  re turn with him . then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there  s the bloody standoff . no real political message like the film  burn  but just another contrived plot device to move the story along . incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back  i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad . the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton  s lack of any accent make it at times laughable . very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel .  
three flash  backs introduce the main characters  abu  jaffar  and the princess  who will interact with ahmad three are the songs  each linked to those same characters . three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word  time   in his declaration of love to the princess  answering her three questions at their first of three meetings . so strong is the impression he causes  that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her  by three successive ploys deceit  hypnosis  and memory erasing . yet  jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman the whip  the power  and the sword . three is the number of flying entities the mechanical  horse  the genie  and the the genie and the magic carpet . the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges  and three are his considerations about human frailty  before he departs . abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn  armed guards  giant  spider  and giant  octopus  . three are the instruments of justice the magical eye that shows abu the future  the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess  and the bow  and  arrow to execute jaffar . there  s magic in the number three  and there is magic in this movie .  
  stars out of a possible    and that is being overly generous .  br    br   i thought with a cast of james woods  cathy bates  randy quaid  lou gossett  jr .  and henry thomas  how could it miss . i was wrong .  br    br   i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week  end he cranked out this piece of dribble . i  d long suspected sam s . of being kind of nuts  this film  based on his play  confirms it .  br    br   this is the kind of artsy b . s . that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . however  for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash  there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie .  br    br   you haven  t seen dysfunctional families until you  ve seen this bunch . pa is crazy  ma is crazy  the son is crazy and the daughter is  oh yeah  crazy . they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush  especially the teenage daughter .  br    br   in addition to the above  as if that weren  t enough  the plot   and it  s so thin you could read thorough it   has a hole in it the size of alaska .  br    br   ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . as it turns out so is pa . now i don  t claim to be a real estate expert  but the last time i checked  property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . if only one of them owned the property  then the other could not legally sell it  so it would be pointless for that person to do so . mr . shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact  and therefore  his plot does not work .  br    br   not that anything else was really working anyway .  br    br   the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity  and i can  t imagine why anyone would want to .  
like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there  s plot  plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life  then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man  s present  where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come .  it must be admitted that the second half doesn  t quite live up to the promise of the first .  like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle  eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work . a freed genie  a beautiful princess  a flying carpet  fantastic mechanical toys  sea voyages  a crowded marketplace  a wicked vizier  jewels . . . i don  t know why it all works  but it does . everything is just so beautiful . the sets are beautiful . june duprez is beautiful . rozsa  s score is especially beautiful . as usual  it sounds hungarian but somehow he manages to convince us that he  s being hungarian in a persian way .  
before seeing this movie  i would  ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done . now it  s everything  minus  one . james woods is pathetic . . . not his character  his acting . someone should  ve told him that  poor  is not synonymous with dirty  nor ignorant  nor cliche . ditto for randy quaid  s stereotyping . the only redeeming feature is henry thomas  who isn  t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess . if you enjoy the country  you  ll enjoy the scenery . that  s the best i can give it .  br    br   i  m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films  but this is simply terrible .  
  the thief of bagdad  is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar  conrad veidt  . he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad  and a gorgeous princess from her father . . .  br    br   he falls victim in the end  as all tyrants do  in books and legends  to love and of the common man whom he ignored  here embodied by the little thief  sabu  .  br    br   the armies of good and evil  black and white  are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms . . .  br    br   the script is poetic  simply and very beautiful . . . the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds  attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror . . .  br    br   the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes  and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues . . .  br    br   for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before  while through its use of color  it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before . . .  br    br   with flying carpet and flying white horse  with a giant genie  excellently played by rex ingram   with evil wizards  and with the good acting of sabu and veidt   the thief of bagdad  captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights . . .  br    br   the     version remains the screen  s finest fairy tale   
this would  ve been a great silent film . the acting really is good  at least in a look ma  i  m doing really big acting  sort of way .  br    br   everything is huge . every line is profound  every scene is shattered by human tragedy   br    br   mostly  i felt like gagging . yet  like any train wreck  i couldn  t tear my eyes away . this dialogue might  ve worked on the stage  although i doubt it . on the screen  it was cluttered  haphazard  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work .  br    br   if you enjoy your melodrama in huge  heaping doses  you might enjoy the movie . be prepared to wait  however . for all that melodrama  this thing sure plods along at its own pace .  br    br   this script must  ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves . it simply doesn  t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera .  br    br   imdb does us a great disservice  at times  when it uses its goofy computer  controlled  weighted score  . curse of the starving class deserves less than a  .  br    br   character  driven fiction is great  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution  it isn  t character development  your characters must have a motivation . being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development . that  s a plot contrivance .  br    br   stay away from this movie . or at the very least  watch it muted . perhaps you  ll get some amusement from all the arm  waving the characters do .  br    br   oh  and word to the wise   to prove that this is truly an artsy film  you see james woods in all his dangly male  look  at  me  i  m  the  figurative  and  literal  representation  of  the  naked  vulnerability  of  man  glory .  br    br   don  t say you weren  t warned .  
the story of the boy thief of bagdad  as it was once spelled  has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in      who starred douglas fairbanks in the first  silent  rendering of  thief of bagdad   to less imposing  more recent attempts . the best  however  remains      s version which for its time was a startling  magical panoply of top quality special effects . those effects still work their charm .  br    br   no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief  abu  john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch  ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier  jaffar  played by a sinister conrad veidt . the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram .  br    br   ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent  he and the boy  abu  suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates . ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt . their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work .  br    br   two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado  like black swirl lawrence w . butler and tom howard .  howard  incidentally  did the special effects for the     version of this film . both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry .   br    br   duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting . justin  s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses . sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he  s very good . for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there  s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind . still  i don  t think anyone under eight ought to see  thief of bagdad .   br    br   this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present . it was great to see computer  besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them .  br    br    thief of bagdad  is a pre  war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases . this is one of the best of its kind .  br    br       .  
this is not a children  s movie     br    br   this movie is like a  bad acid trip  for kids under the age of  . for a month my  year old from time  to  time would ask me  why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth  or  why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits   .  and that wasn  t the worst of it  . we stopped it about a    hour in but the damage had been done . intensely morbid  oppressive  violent . fortunately he  s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing . whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges . . . .  go ahead censure me  my conscience is clear .  .  
i have to agree with mr . caruso jr lanza  s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it . see the film you  ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house . someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza . as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn  t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring .  
probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this  br    br    . they might not have read the book .  . they might enjoy gore and violence in a film .  . they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence .  . people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book .  . there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here .  br    br   the only thing i liked about this film is the song   bright eyes  .  br    br   if perchance  you happen to be one of those people who has read the book  enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence  you are sure not to like this . otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this .  br    br   like in the book  a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . only a few rabbits  including his brother hazel  believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live . . .  
watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non  aggression pact signed in august of     . so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line  the line didn  t change until a couple of months later . lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work .  br    br   the play watch on the rhine ran from april     to february     for    performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler  eric roberts as the youngest son  lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas .  br    br   lukas pulled an award hat trick in     winning an oscar  a golden globe  and the new york film critics for best actor . probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well . the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against  humphrey bogart for casablanca  gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls  mickey rooney in the human comedy  and walter pidgeon for madame curie . every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was . lukas  s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field .  br    br   jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas  s wife was given to bette davis . davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her  but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it . it  s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner  a much lighter play than this one .  br    br   davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days . after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe  davis lukas  and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war . they  re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren .  br    br   the fly in this ointment are some other house guests  a friend of davis  s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe  a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris . coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas  s anti  fascist background .  br    br   his suspicions are quite correct  it  s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they  ve become . lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there . his health has not been the same since . his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes . those decisions affect all the other members of the cast .  br    br   adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman  s significant other . coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell  kurt katch  clyde fillmore  erwin kalser and rudolph anders .  br    br   coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count . he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad .  br    br   lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in      but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls . dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti  fascist classic  casablanca .  br    br   though it  s an item firmly planted in those specific times  watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti  fascist message that bears repeating infinitely .  
how many more of those fake  slice of life  movies need to be made  hopefully not too many .  br    br   raising victor vargas is a very self  conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood . nothing wrong with that in general . what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly  edgy  hollywood independent production .  br    br   it  s supposed to be  real  so left shake the camera  documentary style   except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose . . .  br    br   it  s  edgy  so let  s not waste any time lighting the film .  br    br   it  s  hip   so let  s have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface . . .  br    br   and so on  and so forth . all that you are left with is a very self  conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won  t impress anyone outside of the  rarefied  indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .  
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza . he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer  paired with dorothy kirsten  soprano of the metropolitan opera . indeed  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  check a  vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini  . the mgm art and music departments also did a good job . this movie could be perfect  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before      unforgivable . lanza deserved a better leading lady  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions . also notice that ms . kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .  
ok  i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a  classic  and a standard part of most people  s childhood  but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of    i must admit i really hated it .  br    br   we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it  and many people who whimpered at the very words  watership down   their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams  recommended it . to be honest  i wish i hadn  t bothered . i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i don  t like to stop watching a film half way through . this was an exception . it was really  really  excruciatingly  sickeningly dull . this film was possibly the slowest thing i  ve ever watched  imagine a doped  up snail in space   and really didn  t  do it  for me . the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee  yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced .  br    br   i  m not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area . generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment  it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across . for me  i kind of wished that they would get gassed  not because i  m a horrible sadistic person  but because the characters were uninspiring  annoying  dull and generally quite rude  oh i  m so terribly english  . i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film  and it took a whole   minutes or so before anything actually happened  and even that was a terrible anticlimax .  br    br   if i were to praise it in any way  i  d have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well  meaning . maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy  but the message it  s trying to put forth is good in its nature . the musical score was not bad  too .  br    br   so  to conclude  this film is pretty poor . i couldn  t watch it the whole way through  or i  d probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom . granted  it isn  t  torque  bad  but it still doesn  t rate highly in my eyes  so i  ve given it a     .  br    br   hope this helps .  
this is a most handsome film . the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color . other indoor scenes at various mansions  etc are equally brilliant . as for the music  what more can be said other than that lanza  s voice was at its  peak as he sang so many of the worlds  best known and beloved arias . the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony . of course  hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso . there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events . for example  the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth . there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him . these web sites can be located by using any good search engine . there are also several books available concerning his life history . but  the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film . the voices of lanza  kirsten  and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie . enjoy  i know that i sure did .  
i saw this movie as a very young girl  i  m   now  and it scared me witless for years . i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to  obviously  the violence . my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie . i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it    i am currently reading the book  out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it  s a classic  and it is really a great story . however i don  t think that it should have been made into a cartoon . ever . well  maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way . gives me a little heart palpitation every time . yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids  read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content . not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there     
mario lanza  of course  is  the great caruso  in this     film also starring ann blyth  dorothy kirsten  eduard franz and ludwig donath . this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary  world  renowned tenor whose name is known even today .  br    br   the film is opulently produced  and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza  kirsten  judmila novotna  blanche thebom  and other opera stars who appeared in the film . if you  re a purist  seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from  lucia  will strike you as odd  even if caruso  s wife dorothy just had a baby girl . also it  s highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia the role lay too high for him .  br    br   in taking dramatic license  the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso  s life . what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire  yet this is never mentioned in the film . these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in  girl of the golden west   there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga . the reason for that photo  his only shirt was in the laundry . he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking  machine company  later rca victor  . he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake .  br    br   instead  the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha  which never happened . he had a hemorrhage during  l  elisir d  amore  at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met  his last role as eleazar in la juive . what killed him  the same thing that killed valentino  peritonitis . his first role at the met was not radames in aida  as indicated in the film  but the duke in rigoletto . so when it says on the screen  suggested by dorothy caruso  s biography of her husband   that  s what it was  suggested . what is true is that dorothy  s father disowned her after her marriage  and left her   of his massive estate . they also did have a daughter gloria together  who died at the age of   on           . however  caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy .  br    br   some people say that lanza  s voice is remarkably like caruso  s  but just listen to caruso sing in the film  match point    caruso  s voice is remarkably unlike lanza  s . in fact  from his sound  had he wanted to  caruso could have sung as a baritone . he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes  further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was othello  a dramatic tenor role  which lanza definitely was not . lanza  s voice deserved not to be compared with another . he made a unique contribution to film history  popularizing operatic music . he sings the music in  the great caruso  with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career . his acting is natural and genuine . ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself .  br    br   really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans  which are probably one and the same .  
firstly  i am not easily scared by . . . anything except for my few phobias  but this movie is absolutely horrific . this is not appropriate for children at all  i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i . couldn  t believe how gory it was for a children  s movie  bunnies being brutally murdered  it  s just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g . i recommend being over  to see this . but don  t get me wrong  it was probably a good movie if i wasn  t scarred mentally as a child . i cannot believe a parent would allow a  let  s say   year old child to watch this . it  s just to intense and complicated  not to forget gory  for young kids . i  m wayy over  and i was shocked by the violence . i don  t recommend  
yes  be my love was mario lanza  s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today . his voice was strong and steady  so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso . lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso . having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza  he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza . there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story  but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood  i used to practise singing his songs years ago  and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema  asthma ten years ago . reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful   
so . . . it  s really sexist  and classist  and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie  like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change . well  he certainly changed his tune  and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit . what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers . the end of the movie does not make her a hero  it makes the whole thing sad . and its sad that people think it makes her a hero . perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away . positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience . yuck .  
since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio  i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso .  br    br   but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro  goldwyn  mayer had mario lanza under contract . no one else could have done it  i doubt whether it will ever be tried again .  br    br   and why should it . i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen . for his tenor voice was his life  his reason for being on the earth .  br    br   to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest . caruso  like the man who portrayed him  was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline . he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film .  br    br   his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought . he  s shown in a recording studio once late in his life . actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became .  br    br   when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live . but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men . it  s why both became the legends that they are .  br    br   what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza  a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera . the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design .  br    br   mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso . unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn  t get an actual cast album with ann blyth  dorothy kirsten  and jarmila novotna also .  br    br   though blyth sang it in the film  lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso .  br    br   if you  re looking for a life of enrico caruso  this ain  t it . if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career  than you should not miss the great caruso .  
i should love this movie . the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap . the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it . again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really don  t like the story line . just a personal preference . thank you  
the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in     and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most  movergoers  were stay  at  homes watching their new   motorola televisions . almost all recent box office figures are false    because they fail to adjust inflation . obviously today  s    movies will dominate . in     it cost   c to   .   at radio city   c to   c first run at loew  s palace in washington dc  or   c to   c in neighborhood runs . what counts is the number of people responding to the picture  not unadjusted box office  media spin .  the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso  really not a great story anyway  and threw it in the trash . instead     of the movie  s focus was on the music . thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best  ever historic opera singer enrico caruso . the result was a wonderful movie . too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating . too fat to play the student prince  edmund purdom took his place    with lanza  s voice dubbed in  and with the formerly handsome and not  fat lanza pictured in the advertising . if you want to see the great caruso  it  s almost always on ebay for   .   or less . don  t be put off by the low price  as it reflects only the easy availability of copies  not the quality of the movie .  
this movie is great  mind you  but only in the way it tells a very bad story . stella is so terribly crude  and never learns better . her husband is incredibly snobby and small  minded . neither ever learns better . is this realistic  somehow  stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners  dress  yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down  i don  t think so . stella is a good woman  and a very good mother . giving up herself  so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting .  br    br   much of what we see might have been normal for the times  people having a beer or two  enjoying a player piano  dancing  but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority .  i can  t have our child living this way   spare me .  br    br   this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes . and that is simply a load of hogwash .  
i like it because of my recent personal experience . especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite . the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their  real  lives  but they did enjoy themselves  i . e . what they were . the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory . a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city  but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life . many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those . before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way  which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film . before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head . it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities . this made the conversations between the characters interesting  not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas . you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story . the end was not quite important after all . you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie . movies are supposed to be enjoyable . this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it . i am on a journey too . the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions .  
i hate this movie . it is a horrid movie . sean young  s character is completely unsympathetic . her performance is wooden at best . the storyline is completely predictable  and completely uninteresting . i would never recommend this film to anyone . it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see .  
jesse and celine  ethan hawke and julie delpy  are two strangers on a european train . the two come from widely different backgrounds  he  s american and she  s french  after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him . during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other . but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise .  br    br   this wonderful romantic  comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline . written and directed by richard  dazed and confused  linklater   before sunrise  never bores because of its  small cast . in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two . smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans .  
well  they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied . i don  t know if stella james  sean young  qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac  but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men . she  s still exploring  trying to find  more data  so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it  though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now .  i can  t agree  however  with anyone who says young is too old for the role . if she is  we should all age so nicely .  for the most part this film left me cold  though it  s by no means the worst of its type you  ll ever see . and unlike the recent  eyes wide shut   at least something happens in this one .  
amazing movie that  in theory  should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding . instead of relying on clichs and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments . the lead characters are not perfect  and so relating to them as people you could know is easy . the movie is not trying to pull laughs  or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance .  br    br   i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel . a moving  thought provoking  funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany  s . will soften even the hardiest heart .  
did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did  the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last . oh my god . it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy . not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been . most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can  t understand why . i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought  no  they would never do that  that  s far too lame .  i can hardly stand it . i feel so unsatisfied . i think i  m about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own . someone please . change my mind . i want to love this . so bad . someone tell me why i  m wrong . great show . terrible ending .  
i  m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good . i was stunned . easily the most romantic thing i  ve ever seen in my life . stunning . brilliant  sweet  funny and full of heart . the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing .  br    br   ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they  re a couple .  br    br   the movies grabs you right away and doesn  t let go . you can  t look away nor can you stop listening to them . even the little moments just melt your heart .  br    br   this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever . a masterpiece .  
the first half was ok  but the last half really  really disappointed . it  s funny the producers even admitted they didn  t have a clue for the ending  and it really showed . whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this . i really didn  t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn  t really worth that effort . when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake  it didn  t happen that first season border on being space porn . they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama  so i started watching again . but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel  same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .  
an american woman  her european husband and children return to her mother  s home in  watch on the rhine   a     film based on the play by lillian hellman  and starring paul lukas  whom i believe is repeating his stage role here   bette davis  lucile watson  george coulouris  geraldine fitzgerald  and donald woods . an anti  fascist  a worker in the underground movement  many times injured  and wanted by the nazis  kurt muller  lukas  is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother  in  law . but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests  coulouris  is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out .  br    br   great performances abound in this film  written very much to put forth lillian hellman  s liberal point of view . it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released  as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes . the movie  s big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in  casablanca .  humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick  but lukas is transcendent as kurt . the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut  wrenching  just to mention one scene .  br    br   though this isn  t what one thinks of as a bette davis movie  she gives a masterful performance here as kurt  s loyal and loving wife  sara . her acting tugs at the heart  and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender .  br    br   the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions . lillian hellman is not everyone  s cup of tea  but unlike  the little foxes   she has written some truly sympathetic  wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers . highly recommended .  
first of all  write the script on a napkin . who needs more than that  after all we  re not a hollywood film .  br    br   then get amateur actors . it will be good for the festival hype . after all  who needs people who have spent years honing their craft  then  hire a cinematographer who doesn  t know how to light . you see  if it  s well  lit  it won  t look  real  and the festival people won  t like it . who needs to have professional level photography anyway  then hire a ten  year old who has never held a camera to be your operator . it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for  reality  and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people  critics and a small sliver of the audience who over  intellectualize will scream  genius  because they won  t believe this was just complete amateur  hour .  br    br   once you  ve done that  buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance .  br    br   what a sad waste .  
i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago . having saw it twice  i couldn  t help but missing before sunrise  not because the sequel was not as great  but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did  every time i finished watching one of them  i feel the need and yearning to see the other . so  i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly  i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly . the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other . it sounds so simple  the growing of the chemistry  i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development  but to me  who doesn  t believe in nora ephron  before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it . when i saw it for the first time  about  year ago when i was    i already liked it . but  i didn  t rate it as a  great film   it still seemed to me like another thinking persons  feel good movie  linklater was too smart to make it more realistic  it was   minutes too long  the characters was too well fabricated  i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations  etc . etc . . but now  thanks to before sunset  i feel that  s more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before . i saw the elements more clearly jesse  celine  vienna  their conversations  everything . how each of them are separated element by itself  and they have a chance to mix  the story is just a frame of time  i am no longer feel manipulated . and the freedom that every scene has  as well as its refusal to be overly efficient  how blind i was that those qualities didn  t strike me as exceptional when i first saw it  now   year have passed  the more movies i  ve seen  the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending  even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters  s own slackers included . the jesse and celine tale avoid that  maybe before sunset is a better example in this case  but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time  not a destination  every single scene has its own life . i don  t know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise  but to me  one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other . before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes  seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine  the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it . meanwhile  i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset  and celine  s first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i  ve seen in a beginning of a film  and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don  t know with a sadness in me  no matter how beautiful paris is  and no matter how happy i am that they meet again . i  m sorry that i go on this long with my limited english  before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts  and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it .  
there are many good things about the new bsg there  s the multiple cylon roles for model  and   for example  which the two actresses played superbly . there  s the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica   my ship will not be networked  over my dead body    also  all the space battles  the special effects  even though the seasoned sci  fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all  the darkness of the characters  their essentially flawed nature .  br    br   that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish .  br    br   yes  the first part  the scenes in space  the raid on the cylons and all that was very good . but the mushy ending  i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden  so i never know how much time is left until the end . so for me it was a special kind of torture  to see the end happen over and over again . every time i thought  oh this is the final scene  the final shot  i got one more . every frakking character got its complete ending  that wasn  t really necessary .  br    br   what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all the young roslin scenes . why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupil  student  what does that bring to the story  where was the linkage  now  i  m all for a more european  ish style approach  and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows  and all that  but this was just ridiculous . this didn  t bring anything meaningful to the story .  br    br   also  i  ve seen the  last frakkin special  and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldn  t come up with a good ending for the story  so . . . . he just didn  t  it  s never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be . the whole  this was thousands of years in the past  idea  the mitochondrial eve thing  was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  and believe you me  there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h  g  storyline . and speaking of hera  now there  s a storyline that was not worked out well  at all . instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who  s   years younger . don  t get me wrong  i  m all for older women with younger men . the more power to them . but this . . . just made no sense .  br    br   all in all   the writing in  this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be . that goes even moreso for the last episode . i hope lost and   do better  with their series finales .  
i  m not even sure what to say about this film . it  s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic . to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa  like dancing about architecture  . it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again . this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write . the ending is left open and ambiguous  no happy ending here  just mystery . no profound life lessons  just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings . . . . . . romantic love .  br    br     out of   watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
i loved the first season . the quality went down a little bit in the second season  which however had a great middle  pegasus   . third season was fairly novel and original and was ok . fourth season started going downhill fast  because they never even began giving us any explanations  when by now we were really starting to need them . what the hell was the cylon plan  why were there two cylon factions  what was the point of angel  kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth    what kind of a past did the last five cylons have  and how did they survive  or were they reincarnations  questions everywhere  answers nowhere .  br    br   and then comes the end . earth    our earth  in the past . well  okay . but destroying the fleet   giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life  and spreading a few thousand people paper  thinly across the planet   that  s not only anti  science  it  s anti  reason and anti  life . and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a . i . that ruins everything . it is without vision  without hope for a grander future for humanity  and it is antithetical to proper science fiction . and don  t even get me started on the angels  religious claptrap of the worst kind  the ultimate disappointment    br    br   the whole  all this has happened before and will happen again  thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series  not just to earth as we know it . making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius . frakkin shame .  br    br    out of   .  
i must admit that at the beginning  i was sort of reticent about watching this movie . i thought it was this stupid  little  romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him . i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script  since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie . still  i watched it  and i was amazed . . .  before sunrise  is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way  wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth  we are sentenced to death  or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity  or that  we  humans  can afford sometimes to live in fairy  tales .  br    br   the ending was wonderfully chosen  we do not know if they will meet again in six months  at six o  clock  in vienna  s station   in our optimism  we sincerely hope so . the actors acted in a very good manner  so  that  i began to believe that i  myself could live a love  story just like this .  
horrible ending  and i can  t believe moore spent a year coming up with it . smacks of l . ron hubbard and dianetitcs  which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first  .  years . now  the first  .  hours were action packed  though absurd in the premise  and then it deteriorated into a slow  painful  sophomoric dissolution of the series . unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . were we to think more deeply  if i wanted a lesson in a  materialism  i would reread daniel quinn  s ishmael . absurd to think   k people would give up everything for a  fresh start  . absurd to throw in a disappearing kara  and a reappearing baltar and six . absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve . just absurd .  
american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa . on the train he met a french girl celine . although they met the first time  they talked like good friends . when the train stopped at vienna  jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna . then the romantic story unfolded .  br    br   at first they were cautious . the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store . they peeked at each other  though their eyes did not contact . after in  depth conversation  they relationship became close . then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend . their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words .  br    br   love is a strange thing . when you really want it  it will not come as you wished . love needs mutual understanding . without it  love will not last long . spiritual harmony is the most important for love .  br    br   excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie .  br    br   one of the best romance movies .      
the fight scenes were great . loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side . it was the ending that i hated . i was disappointed that it was earth but    k years back . but to travel all that way just to start over  are you kidding me    k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise  they abandon technology  no way . sure they were eating paper and rationing food  but that is over . they can live like humans again . they only have one good doctor . what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth . . . yea right . no one would have made that choice .  
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people . presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart . a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions . the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation . the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed . ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch . a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love . by far the most romantic  at least one of them  movie of all times .  
did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak     god was behind everything  what has god got to do with sci  fi  god is only the answer when you can  t think up a sensible explanation for something . in fact  this is exactly the problem with the series finale  they obviously couldn  t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper  how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth   why baltar has an imaginary  in his head  why  has an imaginary baltar in her head  etc . so they explain it with  angels  or just don  t explain it at all .  br    br   the plot of the last  episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through . for example  why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl  hera   particularly after adama said there was no way he  d attempt a rescue  because they found out the location of the cylon base  that  s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew  s lives . and how did anders know the location  and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters  lives before the war  it  s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment .  br    br   the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series . feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread  the word  . forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot  the important message the writers wanted to get across is don  t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation  tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment  .  br    br   imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no  force  . . . instead  a jedi actually gets his power from jesus . then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks . would this be a good ending  no it frakken  wouldn  t .  
my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together . . . which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism . . . and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships  as a lot has been written about the movie already  it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved .  br    br   i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending   hrs . . . the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with . . .  br    br   on the plot front  making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish . .  br    br   i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor  the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer  s and director  s mind . what the actors bring out is what becomes of them . . right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify . . . to become the character  the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story . . . here both the actors do just the right job  kudos . .    and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful   
with these people faking so many shots  using old footage  and gassing animals to get them out  not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors  what  s to believe  old film of countries is nice  but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films . i know  racism is ok in these old films  but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility . portrayed as fliers  they never flew their planes  martin johnson was an ex  vaudevillian  used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties  denying his wife  s apparent depression  using her as a cute prop  all this makes these films unbearable . they were by no means the first to travel to these lands  or the first to write about them . he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer  but that  s about it .  
i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of  before sunrise        and  before sunset         and saw both films in a row  without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately . after sleeping it over  i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter  and i shall explain why .  br    br   before sunrise introduces us with then young actors  ethan hawke  reality bites  dead poets society   only   at the time of the film  s release and julie delpy  the three colors trilogy   then    although looking much younger  . he is a promiscuous american writer  touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student  on her way home to paris . they meet on the budapest  vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together . the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna  exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love .  br    br   the film has      s written all over it back then  technology was leaping rapidly  the new millennium with all it  s hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner  and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future . the characters of jesse  hawke  and celine  delpy   with all their flaws and inconsistencies  celine  s accent  if by mistake or on purpose  was half american  half french  and it swinged from one spectrum to the other  breaking the character  s credibility   were a mirror of the time . watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement  acting all clichd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well  is what really made this movie work for me . the fact that the director doesn  t let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while .  br    br   all in all  sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna  a well told classical romantic rendezvous  and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future .  
the     s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world  with an emphasis on wild animals  exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures . despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place  and then bringing  em back alive  with the film footage   such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features . . . because there were no expensive sets  costumes  or high  priced movie stars .  br    br   the most successful makers of such films  artistically and financially  were the team of martin e . johnson and his wife osa  who made several documentaries  sometimes with blatantly staged events  in africa and asia . the johnsons  safari films were extremely popular  inspiring several parodies . . . most notably wheeler  woolsey  s  so this is africa   in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs . johnson  martini  instead of martin e . johnson  geddit   . although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time  the johnsons  films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour . viewed from our own more enlightened  i hope  standpoint  this is a serious flaw in the johnsons  documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife .  br    br   one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson . ten years younger than her husband  she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir  osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co  produced with her husband .  br    br    congorilla  is probably the best of the johnsons  films . the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in     . the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting  although these suffer from the johnsons  penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look  wild  and alien .  br    br   the best  and funniest  scene in  congorilla  is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women .  the dance is the black bottom  no less . . . the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton  the conjoined twins .  wearing jodhpurs  riding boots  and a pith helmet  osa johnson starts scat  singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women . meanwhile  they just stand there staring at her  apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . it  s a very funny scene  but it has unpleasant undertones . osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration  using natural rhythm  i guess  because it  s in their blood  or something .  br    br   i  ll rate  congorilla   points out of   . this film says a little bit about african life in the     s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade .  
this is a slow moving story . no action . no crazy suspense . no abrupt surprises . if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking  about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey  dovey romance  don  t waste your time and money .  br    br   on the other hand  if you  re into dialog  masterful story telling  thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie . i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert  though  because the pace  the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood . it  s truly fantastic . i really mean that .  br    br   ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but  thankfully  the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural  warm and tender . they act and feel each other out from the very beginning  making you feel as an intruder .  br    br   in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner . i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence . still it did not ruin the movie .  br    br   the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it  s charm and ultimately it  s power .  br    br   bottom line the movie  s flow is slow . the dialog is fascinating . the story builds gently  systematically and substantive . the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding .  
admirably odd  though mean  spirited comedy  drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome . robert altman  directed quasi  comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight . some of the cinematography is evocative  shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide  and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort  s vision of a  mother bird   imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her   . in the lead  bud cort is   once again  after  harold  maude    a true original not off  putting like  say  michael j . pollard  cort manages to be geeky  wacky and inoffensive  a tough act to pull off . unfortunately  this is one of altman  s misfires . he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else  but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward .  from   
after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love . the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines . as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown  eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid  twenties . risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving . we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating . further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing .  br    br   if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar . ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g . krebs of the nineties . attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots . his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee . nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two  week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine . his oft  cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation . when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere .  br    br   after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it . jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up .  br    br   given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp . he contents himself with a half  baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year . when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant . for whatever reason  she probably won  t show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if he  s lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone .  br    br   despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie . i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset .   
the movie sucked  it wasn  t funny  it wasn  t exciting . they tried to make it so bad that it would be good  but failed . and thinking it  s cool to like this movie  next to the hype  are the only reasons that this movie is a success . . .  br    br   the fact that at this moment    voted a   out of   for this movie seems pretty concerning to me  either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes  and should be dealt with . anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising . it  s success can only be described as a marketing marvel .  
when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in     via a free advanced screening  i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it . i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended . i  on the other hand  felt completely the opposite . i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else . people i talked to said there was too much talking  plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters . i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie  going public seems to have a tendency to want easy  to  follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused . they also like to be spoon  fed tidy endings   happy or sad . this disgusts me . nobody wants to be challenged anymore    and as for the ending  and i don  t want to be a spoiler   i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again . it  s all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny . it  s a very personal film that doesn  t speak to all people . but it certainly spoke to me . give it a chance  be patient with it  richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna . watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters . as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass . it  s very intimate . plus  ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life . they must have improvised during some parts and it works well . they have a great chemistry in their roles . their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses . i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr . linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made . it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much . bravo for romance     
i  d like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot    for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest  crappiest movie i  ve ever seen   br    br   i have no idea what  s wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here  imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings  . . . the only thing i can imagine is that people must  ve voted during one or more conditions  br    br    . while being shitfaced  stoned out of their minds  . they  ve received hard cash for the votes  . under gunpoint  br    br   i can  t believe i wasted a good  h   min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .  
ever since i can remember and i  m only   my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run  but hey don  t get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the   s and   s  anyways  now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv . of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson . but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed . the children . . . did not act like children in the slightest . but there is good reason for that  having had to hid and run most of your life  seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence . so people saying  oooo i hated how the kids acted . . . blah blah blah  read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see .  br    br   paul lukas . . . dear paul did an amazing job    now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn  t but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way . but lukas  performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears . i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone     d  
what a bad  bad film    i can  t believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious  amateurish excuse for a real movie   i left the theater before the end  stunned by how bad the direction and camera  work of that movie were   and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry .  br    br   at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film  making than anything else .  br    br   avoid at all costs . you  ll want your time back  i know i did .  
this movie is intelligent . that is  more than most other movies  it transcends the least common denominator  stupid people will probably not appreciate it . the story also relies heavily on dialogue . it has some parallels to lost in translation  although before sunrise is much brighter  somehow less abstract  and simply a lot better .  br    br   the script  the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic . the actors play absolutely brilliantly . rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together .  br    br   the dialogue moves into very personal issues  with the risk of becoming a little over the top . it does  however  stay on the right side almost all the time  although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing . balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors . sometimes  it yields great results  and overall this movie is simply stupendous  only very  very rarely is  love  in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic . every time that is achieved  the result is fantastic . i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect . she still looks stunning in this film    years after .  br    br   this is simply a gem of a movie that you can  t miss . one of the best movies i have seen from the     s   
unless you are between the ages of   and    except for the r rating   there are very few things to like here . one or two lines from kenan thompson  david koechner  we really should see him more  and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings  but sadly  that  s it . poor plot . poor acting . worse writing and delivery . the special effects are dismal . as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke  the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible . if we consider the action portions  well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan . this movie only contains the latter kind . this leaves little left . i  m so glad i did not pay for this .  br    br   despite any hype  i can read and think  so as i sat down to watch  i did not expect anything good . i had no expectations  but was somewhat worried going in . yet  like a train wreck  one cannot merely look away . and even with no expectations  i was let down . bad . not even  so bad  it  s good  material . i  m  very  tolerant of bad movies  but this makes  six string samurai   which i liked  oscar worthy .  br    br   no  this piece of over cgi  d rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth  little man and gigli . how this is currently rated a  .  completely mystifies me . brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers .  br    br   i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight  i witnessed a train wreck . i need to go wash my eyes .  of    
before sunrise has many remarkable things going on  almost too many to fit into one review like this  but it  s suffice to say that it  s one of the most observant character studies of the nineties  maybe even in all of contemporary cinema  to be observant not about love  per  say  so much as it  s about a human connection . how does one fall in love at first sight  no one does  at least that  s deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film . and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection  of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time . linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie  a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna  and on the way there start to talking about things  at first arbitrary  then personal  jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather  . jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the  town   in vienna  until his plane the next morning .  br    br   before sunrise gives jessie and celine  in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance  and in a sense is about the act of having conversations  of what it  s like to watch people having one leading into another and another . here it  s often about relationships and commitments  as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential  or seemingly so  and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities . we hear confessions of desires for other loves  or what weren  t really loves  of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you  ll love your life  of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form  or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul  i loved the bit about the quakers in the church   and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism . jessie may be more responsible for that last part  but what  s fascinating about the film is that it  s never exactly cynical itself  just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives .  br    br   meanwhile  it  s always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles  where they  re not incessantly annoying in that   s generation  x mode  but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film  which isn  t a bad one at all but a necessary one  one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere . the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter  only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other  where sweet asides are actually acceptable   i have to tell you a secret   jessie says  and then leans in for a kiss  ho  ho   or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way . i loved the scene with the poet  where it  s very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal  or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share  but really are seeing them do it first  hand . all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly  we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives  as it may lead off into the future . . .  br    br   featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness  however self  contained  as it may lead into something more . who  s to say you can  t suddenly be attached to someone  if only for less than   hours  and be that much more attached than a married couple  this is perhaps linklater  s thesis  but there  s more to it than just that . it  s a very dense film  and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly . one scene especially  which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking  on the phone  in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other  s friend . a  
i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started  taking over  the plane .  br    br   at first i thought maybe it should get a  one  for the comic relief . but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more   br    br   whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed . and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are . when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun . the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay . and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that .  br    br   this movie isn  t worth a trip to blockbuster . be warned if you pay for it  the only  victim  is your dumb ass .  br    br   if you want to be really scared  i suggest the descent . if you want humor  go to your local stand up comedy club . their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash .  
this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i  ve ever seen . closely followed by none other than  before sunset   which technically isn  t another movie at all  since it  s about the same two people and the same romance .  br    br   this is  love  in the real world . ok  that  s only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie . reading the other reviews  it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog  based movies as well . and this is what makes  before sunrise  so good . the dialog is perfect . it  s so real  so engaging and funny . it  s hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love   coz you fall in love with them at the very same time .  br    br   my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop  where they pretend to phone their best friends  with the other pretending to be said best friend . it  s perfect . brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life .  br    br   i must say that if you have a choice  do watch  before sunrise  before watching  before sunset  . if like me  you watched  sunset  first  it  s hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show .  br    br   once again  the greatest romantic movie in my books . wonderful acting  excellent script  and beautiful locations . young love  at it  s best .  
all internet buzz aside  this movie was god awful . i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything . instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller  horror movie  and they completely missed . there were only a few good parts  and a couple good lines by samuel jackson . other than that  it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes . all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie . now that the movie has actually come out  hopefully this joke will die . don  t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash . if you  re looking for something that  s funny and entertaining  then just go to snakes on a blog .  
richard linklater  s beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the    s best thinking person  s romantic movies . julie delpy turns in one of the decade  s most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger  on  a  train ethan hawke . the dialogue  and there is oodles of it  is sometimes meandering and overly precious  but this portrait of two young wannabe  lovers making a romantic  intellectual  and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing  touching and insightful moments .  
i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i  along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience  were vastly disappointed . the movie wasn  t even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake  bite victim . samual l . jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame . it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies  except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy . it all seemed worn  flat  and overtly formulaic . i  m shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun . it  s easy to understand that soap realizes it  s a piece of sit and plays along with it  but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense . it  s the worst kind of lame movie it  s joyless .  
sweet and charming  funny and poignant  plot less but meaningful   before sunrise         the third movie of richard linklater  is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love  is in love  or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it . it is one of the very rare movies that is  should  will be equally interesting to teenagers  their parents and even grandparents . it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects  car chases  or long and steamy sex scenes . two young people in their early   s  two college students  american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne  meet on a train . they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking  they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night . they talk and fall in love . that  s it  that  s the movie . it could  ve been boring and silly but instead  it is a lovely  believable  clever  and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing  at least  for this viewer  . high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters  superb writing  always interesting and witty dialogs  two awesome performances  and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is . julie delpy  who looks like a botticelli  s angel  is great in portraying smart  independent  and incredibly attractive young woman .  
the only thing great about the movie is its title . in this case   snake on a plane  is example of not judging the book by its cover  the title says nothing about the movie . when i went to the theater  i wasn  t expecting citizen kane  i was expecting independence day  a movie that  s pure popcorn fun  but instead  i got that horrible roy liotta movie called  turbulence  yes  this is how bad soap is . the only thing make soap better is its title . and it  s not even the apporiate title for the movie  the wasn  t even a glimpse of  snake  or  plane    minutes into the movie  what a false advertising  if it wasn  t for its title  soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b  grade summer movie . and the r rating  it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time  the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r  all of the violence are kept pg    level . you know what  s really r rated  the r rated superstar edge  see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake   
first let me say that before sunrise  like all movies  is not a movie for all tastes . it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact  but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people . for me  like most folks here  before sunrise struck a deep chord in me  i was truly stunned  moved  inspired by it . this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing . it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine . it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it .  br    br   the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other . it is very intelligent and inspiring  not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine  s discussions  but rather the little nuances  the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other . it captures an honest  romantic  yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world . and what happens after that night is open for debate  but i never doubt that they won  t each other again .  br    br   the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie .  br    br   see it and it may change your way of life .  
this must be one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen  the graphics are ridiculous  and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process .  br    br   i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie  so i can  t say i  m picky . i have been struggling to find something to compare it to  but i just can  t think of anything that matches this  maybe starship troopers  . witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player  but compared to this its effects are great . the acting superb and the script should be awarded . you know when a movie is bad in a funny way  well folks this isn  t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute .  
i watched this movie   years ago . and have watched it on video an average of once a year since . it  s the type of movie that  s timeless  because the themes are universal  yet the stories and conversation are so personal . it  s also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll  despite the fact that there are  really  just two  very involving  characters . this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy  who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine . this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv  and now  the phenomenon is rampant  i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space  and makes you think  however jaded you may be  that you are one of those characters . it also made me want to ride the train around europe  i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie . maybe that speaks about myself  my friends  or just the sheer genius of this movie .  
b movie at best . sound effects are pretty good . lame concept  decent execution . i suppose it  s a rental .  br    br    you put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison  den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen . you gonna be ok tommy .   br    br    you stay by the airphone  when agent harris calls you get me    give me a fire extinguisher .   br    br    weapons  we need weapons . where  s the silverware  all we have is this . sporks     br    br   dr price is the snake expert .  br    br   local ers can handle the occasional snakebite . alert every er in the tri  city area .  
there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime  but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives . these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don  t meet these people anymore . we don  t always even know their names  as we are never presented to each other  and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are . it  s funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such  because reuniting might spoil fond memories  or we don  t know do they . we are too afraid to check that out .  br    br   the movie  before sunrise  just caught me watching it . i never had intention to watch it through  but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting  i gave a look for the rest of the film . i didn  t know what to expect from it  but nor did the young couple . they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate . i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through . it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives .  
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb . but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone  s been fixing the score .  br    br   either way it was a real disappointment . the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest . there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot  but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking  wouldn  t it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane  and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff     and that  s about it  the plot is thin and unoriginal . the snakes are bad cgi  but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone   . the acting is poor  and all people are unbelievable stereo types .  br    br   to sum it up it  s one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen  stay away   
if you are a traveller  if there is a fire burning into your heart  if you  d call  home  every place on earth  but none of them can give you enough  if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there  see this movie and you  ll find out a little  but wonderful  piece of life sitting next to you .  
oh dear lord  how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone  it reeks of cheese from start to finish  but it  s not even good cheese . it  s the scummiest  moldiest  most tasteless cheese there is  and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually  truly enjoyed it . yes  if you saw it with a load of drunk  stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way  but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen . i watched it with an up  for  a  few  laughs guy  having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film  s expected crapness . we got the crapness  plenty of it   but not the chuckles . it doesn  t even qualify as a so  bad  it  s  good movie . it  s just plain bad . very  very bad . here  s why  look away if you  re spoilerphobic   the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death . ok  i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was  but i think i grasped the  this guy is a bit of a badass who you don  t want to mess with  message behind the ingenious scene . oh  and a guy witnesses it . so  we already have our ultra  evil bad guy  and wussy but cute  apparently  good guy . cue hero . big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion  saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish  i . e . hero is immune to bullets  everyone else falls over rather clumsily . cue first plot hole . how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was  or that he  d watched the murder . perhaps this  and the answers to all my plot  hole related questions  was explained in the  minutes before i got into the cinema  but i doubt it . in fact  i  m going to stop poking holes in the plot right here  lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese  which we all know is good cheese  . so  the  plot   a very generous word to use  . good guy must get to la  evil guy would rather he didn  t  hero sam stands between the two . cue scenery for the next vomit  inducing hour  the passenger plane . as i said  no more poking at plot holes  i  ll just leave it there . passenger plane . next  the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie  and what makes it everything it is  snakes . yay  oh  pause . first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have . hot  horny couple  see if you can guess how they die   dead  before  any  snakes  even  appear british guy  those pesky brits  eh    cute kids  and jo brand . for all you americans that  s an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness . now that we  ve met the cast  let  s watch all of them die  except of course the cute kids  . don  t expect anything original  it  s just snake bites on various and ever  increasingly hilarious  really not  parts of the body . use your imagination  since the film  makers obviously didn  t use theirs .  br    br   so  that  s most of the film wrapped up  so now for the best bit  the ending . as expected  everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face . yep  ice  cool sammy included . but wait  we  re not all off the plane yet  the last guy to get off is good guy  but just as he does he gets bitten by a  you guessed it  snake  of all things  . clearly this one had been hiding in mr . jackson  s hair the whole time  since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier  despite the    ft constrictor  the one that ate that pesky british bugger  being unable to . so  sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop . at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much  needed u  turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort . but no . in a kind of icing on the cake way  but with stale cheese  remember   it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest . how anyone can think that an audience   years ago  let alone in     would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me  but it did well in summing up the film .  br    br   actually  we  re not quite done yet . after everyone has sucked face  uncle sam with leading actress  good guy with tiffany  token black guy with token white girl  and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia   it  s time for good guy and hero to get it on . . . . in bali    nope  it wasn  t at all exciting  the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll . yes  the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred  and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times . that  s it . this is the first time i  ve ever posted a movie review  but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography . if you like planes  snakes  samuel l . jackson  air hostesses  bad guys  surfing  dogs in bags or english people  then please  please don  t see this movie . it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you  ll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again . go see united   instead . that was good .  
i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago  but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking . it sparked my interest  but i never expected it to be this great . before sunrise is a masterpiece  and it  s also one of the most romantic films on record . to my surprise  it completely lacked the cynicism of the     s . it  s impossible to really talk too much about it  since there is no real plot  so to speak  although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre  where there is a conversation  but it  s not just the conversation that matters   but let me just say  see it . see it   
this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it  s production . the audience became the film  makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend . how is it possible to be objective  this is our movie  isn  t it  or is it  there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film  maker who promotes himself as the audience  s friend  giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them . just look at that prime self  publicist eli roth  promising gore  hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films  only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like  hostel  .  br    br   david r . ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film  but he was  quite understandably  quick to engage with it . he took the carnival  huckster school of film  making to a new level  getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy . so many have enthused over this interactive  democratic approach to film  making that they seem to have missed the point  that this is the most cynical form of film  as  marketing . nothing is included that the film  makers know the fans won  t buy  and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated . the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know .  br    br   isn  t this just the evolution of the focus group approach  individual creativity  talent  craft  ideas  all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses . it  s a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don  t make for good movies  why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different  because we happen to be film fans  well  thank god for us  because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake .  br    br   so  yes  i had fun at the movie  a midnight showing  fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice  cream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film  and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere . like christmas  everyone seemed determined that they would have fun  no matter what . there was laughter  but i don  t know if it was with the film  or at the film . with a film as calculated as this one  is that even a meaningful distinction  there are some genuinely good aspects to the film . samuel l . jackson gives a well  judged performance  pure self  parody but with a real sense of pleasure . rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles  and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate .  br    br   the stock characters are to be expected  but the total lack of suspense isn  t . what  s the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there  s no creeping menace  there are several snake  jumps  out moments  but they  re incredibly badly staged . only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat . the demise of the honeymoon couple  for instance  is shamefully botched . most of the actors fail to make an impression it  s a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired  when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller  coaster  she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far short  .  br    br   there are worse movies  but there are many  many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with  lake placid   and it  s as apt a contrast as any i can think of . that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent  the jokes were funny  the suspense sequences were scary  and it wasn  t devised by committee . that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus . i don  t need a post  pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film .  br    br   this film will  in time  fade to become a mere footnote in film history . if it sets a precedent  however  i  m genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time . in all probability  nothing much will come of it . perennial popcorn favourites   raiders of the lost ark    alien    halloween  and of course   star wars   just aren  t produced by group  think .  br    br   in the mean time  i  ll tell you what  i haven  t half got a craving for some ingmar bergman .  
many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with  the mortal storm  or  casablanca  . everyone is entitled to compare films they choose  but the similarities of  the mortal storm  and  watch on the rhine  are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut  while the main comparative point brought out with  casablanca  is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in     by the academy of motion picture arts and science  because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar . it does not strike me as totally wrong . lukas had a good career in film  both here and in england  he is the villain in  the lady vanishes    and this performance was his best one . bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine  for instance  he was ignored for sam spade in  the maltese falcon  and roy earle in  high sierra  two years earlier  both of which were first rate performances  and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c . dobbs in  the treasure of sierra madres   the writer  murder suspect in  in a lonely place   and captain philip francis queeg in  the caine mutiny  afterward  he got it for charley in  the african queen   . i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs  but it did not happen . but lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career . few can claim that .  br    br   to me the film to look at with  watch on the rhine  is based on another play  script by hellman   the searching wind  . they both look at america  s spirit of isolationism in the     s and     s .  the searching wind  is really looking at the whole inter  war period  while  watch on the rhine   set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii  deals with a few weeks of time . therefore it is better constructed as a play  and more meaningful for it  s impact .  br    br   the film has many good performances  led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti  nazi fighter  courier  davis as his loyal wife  wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play  s activities   coulouris as the selfish  conniving  but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck  lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald  as coulouris  wiser and sadder and fed up wife   and kurt katch  who delivers a devastating critique  as the local embassy  s gestapo chief  about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis . it has dialog with bite in it . and what it says is quite true . it also has moments of near poetry . witness the scene  towards the end  when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis  and says   the new world has left the scene to the old world  . hellman could write very well at times .  br    br   given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films .  
  raising victor vargas  is one of those light  family movies that you can watch and do the n . y . times crossword puzzle at the same time . and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona  you don  t have to  pause  the dvd . just let it roll   cause you won  t be missing anything really important . no twists  turns  or tension . it  s not really an ethnic movie  it  s a movie about a poor  struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino . they could have been any ethnic group . it made very little difference . i  ve seen it all a zillion times before . just plug in a jewish family  an italian family  a black family  or an irish family . just the accents and names were different . if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians  the movie would have been a total snooze .  br    br   it  s funny that the critics here couldn  t get the locale straight . some said it was spanish harlem . some the bronx  and another brooklyn . as a life  long new yorker  i vote for the lower east side . and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos . they lived in an insulated  isolated little enclave . some interaction with non  latinos might have created some excitement  interest  or tension . remember west side story   br    br   and now for the oft  criticized cinematography . i don  t know if it was my tv or what  but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me . the apt  the furniture  and the faces were all orange . what was that supposed to mean  and the apt . did look pretty cramped to me . somebody here mentioned that the old apt  s  tenements had very big rooms . well  maybe   years ago . what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into  or  very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them .  br    br   and another annoying thing . . . . this is the second family movie i  ve seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy  jerking off  . is this private sex act necessary for us to watch  please spare me  what  s up with these directors   br    br   so  victor vargas  is a pleasant little movie . it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents  which they did . but the writers let them down  giving them a flat  unspectacular script to work with . enjoy the show  but keep your fingers near the  fast forward  button .  
it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other . ethan hawke  jesse   tape     and julie delpy  celine   er    tv series  nicole  . this gal and guy  will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years . jesse and celine have great conversation  and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them . i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in     and if you have viewed this film  you will feel the same way .  
this movie was the worst movie i have seen since  date movie .  i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared . it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example  the eye  the tongue  the butt  the breast . if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite . for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person . i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior . i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie . so i don  t recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it .  
  before sunrise  is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top  favorite movies ever . dialog and acting are great . i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts . of course  the romantic vienna  introduced in the movie does not exist  you won  t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night  and it isn  t possible to get to all the places in only one night  either  especially if you  re a stranger and it  s your first night in vienna  . but that  s not the point . the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic . although  nothing ever really happens  the movie never gets boring . the ending is genuinely sad without being  titanic  or something . even if you don  t like love stories you should watch this film  i  m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer . the first part is perfect as it is  in my opinion .  
i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie  rocked  . it is pure cg over  acted crap  don  t send an assassin  it  s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored  aggressive  venomous snakes on a plane  the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to . it is not  so bad it  s good  it  s so bad i  d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again . i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane  a spoof  was i wrong . it  s that whole  it sucks  get it   or samuel a . jackson yells  snakes on the plane  thing . well i  m sorry  i don  t get it . it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard . if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung  s cd  still live in their mommies basement  and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn  then rush to the theater and ask for one  since i doubt you have a girlfriend  ticket for snakes on a stupid  butt plane . to hell with movies like full metal jacket  pulp fiction  true romance    monkeys  clerks  etc . there  s no irony in watching good movies . the true decline of the western civilization . calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man  or even orgazmo . i  ve said enough here .  
i want cline and jessie go further in their relationship  i want to tell them that they were made for each other  that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other . their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached . this is about love but not stupid things like in  notting hills  or those kind of movie . this is life and i did believe in them  i did believe they were falling . . . this was so clever and touching . i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there . . . i want to go to vienna . i want to see them as soon as possible again .  br    br   i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake  a concept  but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere  somehow and some when  something could really happen .  br    br   i  m french and didn  t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski  three colors  white  . . . now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting .  br    br   i saw  before sunset   the sequel in paris  a few days before i saw  before sunrise  and their is no matter . they are both masterpieces . proof that you don  t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings . i  m sorry for my english which i m trying to best .  br    br   franck in france  
i saw the   p . m . showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special . although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back  as i don  t actually pay for movies anymore  i didn  t really find any redeeming qualities .  br    br   there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle  but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger  in mind more than age as this film is rated r  male audience . the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . i know you all want to hear samuel l . say his infamous line  but let  s be honest  it  s a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg  which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen .  br    br   now i am a reasonable man  i knew going into the theater that i wasn  t going to be seeing  casablanka   and i am at least thankful that this film is an original  albiet inane  idea and not some re  make or franchise spin off . however to be honest  if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .  
while traveling by train through europe  the american jesse  ethan hawke  and the french celine  julie delpy  meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria . on the next morning  jesse returns to united states of america  and celine to paris .  br    br    before sunrise  is one of my favorite romances  indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen . it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline  but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect  and the dialogs are stunning . the direction is amazing  transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer . i have just completed my review number      in imdb  and i choose  before sunrise  for this significant number because it is a very special film for me . i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar  with such a magnificent screenplay  direction and performances . yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time  and i still love it . my vote is ten .  br    br   title  brazil    antes do amanhecer    before sunrise    
this movie deserves more than a  . but i  m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a   resulting in it getting a rating that  ll take it into the top    list . seriously it  s not that great its not that bad . its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it  s ridiculous . these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say  i  m rick james b  tch  no matter how old or annoying it gets . i dread having to hear  i  m tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane  months from now from idiots trying to be funny . its crappy plot crap acting etc . its okay to love a bad movie  but you still gotta admit its a bad movie .  br    br   wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie  
before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation . richard linklater  s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people . the film depicts romance in all it  s glory  but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that  s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to  with just one problem  the problem of time . while most relationships wind down with time  this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out . before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental  hollywood romance   which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders . the story follows two people  jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna . they instantly connect  and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train  jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna . . .  br    br   before sunrise works principally for two reasons  realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life . this allows the characters to be free  and it  s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script . this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are  and not merely because they  re the protagonists . this kind of realism is hard to capture as  at the end of the day  we as the audience know that they  re watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen . a truly great script cannot work on it  s own  and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice  and although i  m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film  there is nothing you can do but give them both respect . i don  t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves  but when a film is this good it hardly matters .  br    br   in a film like this  it is the writing that  s the most important thing  and contained within the script are several observations about life  most of which i personally could relate to . this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters  but it also manages to expose what true love is  along with several other aspects of life . the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing . everyone is different  and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people . there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that  s the case with the musings in this script . adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna . the city itself isn  t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere  but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat  energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location .  br    br   before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating . richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental . before sunrise is what it is . and what it is  is pure cinematic brilliance .  
when discussing a movie titled  snakes on a plane   we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot .  br    br   what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes . snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy  they crawl they slither . these snakes do nothing of the sort . they glide along like they would in a video game . they are cartoon snakes . i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary  br    br   why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures  why not rely on suspense . . the whole  less is more  ethic . or better still  why not just make them look good in the first place  and then maybe still use them sparingly  br    br   take one look at john carpenters  the thing  . here we have real slime  and gore of eerie proportions .   years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap  snakes on a plane  . when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee  special effects are going backwards   br    br   sure you could say . . but the movie is a joke  get it  sure i  m with that idea  but do it well  in addition to the above  this movie has crap dialogue . and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way .  br    br   i could handle every other actor being part of this movie  except for jackson . what was he doing there  the man who starred in pulp fiction   years ago . is this career progression  are you offering people value for money  no . i  d like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie  br    br   the current generation seem to have very low expectations . and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want . on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including . . . doa dead or alive   another  cgi animal film called  flushed away   and another crap looking comedy named  click  . in addition to that i saw some awful trailers  including one for  another  crap british horror  comedy . i  ve truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time  br    br   expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for   in  months time . and if you  re expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes  and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips . forget it .  
this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy  meets  girl movies ever made . while  rebel without a cause  and  say anything  deliver nice portrayals  this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences . this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance . you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people . you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine  and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it . this movie is mostly all dialogue  based . but  every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing . what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is . how in all that conversation  while often having no real bearing on anything critical  you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other . this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone . and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe . this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random . and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place . it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests . and no matter how many times i watch this film  i don  t think i will ever tire of that .  
       pyramid clues deep blue sea . tremors . slither . eight legged freaks .  br    br   pyramid category movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane .  br    br   hell  with that definition i  d have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane  as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills .  br    br   the sad truth is that this isn  t even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies anaconda  besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo  cube  o . wilson  stoltz  wuhrer in the same flick  you had jon voight pulling off the all  time cinematic heist . his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a  so  ludicrous  it  s  fun  movie .  br    br   in the end  snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible . every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year  all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop  sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater . i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for  according to jim  .  
this movie is not about entertainment  or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time . this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god . one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie . we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie . there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed . god  s love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal . there is the love in a marriage . while the main character grapples with his wife  s disease  he realizes through god  s love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine . he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated . finally  you have the love of child and parent . the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear . dear friends  love is not love unless it comes from god  because god is love and love comes from god . talk to someone and let them know you love them . love does no good unless it is given to another . i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it . amen    
i  d give this a negative rating if i could . i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind . the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson . oh how original if i were a   year old boy i might laugh at that . i have no idea how this movie became so popular . seriously  the worst thing i  ve ever seen . i wasn  t entertained  it wasn  t funny  i wasn  t even bored  i wasn  t anything . it wasn  t even so bad it was good  it  s just bad . ridiculous actually . please do not waste your money on this movie . don  t even rent this movie . no clue how it  s getting such a high rating .  
forget the campy  religious  movies that have monopolized the television  film market . . . this movie has a real feel to it . while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws  it also has that message of forgiveness  and overall good morals . however  i did not like the lighting in this movie . . . for a movie dealing with such subject matter  it was too bright . i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie  which is almost an unforgivable sin  but the recognizable cast  and their performances counteract this oversight .  br    br   definitely worth seeing . . . buy the dvd .  
what can i say  i  m a secret fan of  over the top  action and horror films . especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo  but i  m not a fan of snake on a plane .  br    br   there are three potential draws to this film  the comedy of the situation  the horror and  the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane .  br    br   firstly  this film isn  t written as a tongue  in  cheek horror or a comedy  and there are only  or  points in the film where you  ll smile to yourself . if you want to get the feel of the film  the trailer genuinely represents the movie  a horror .  br    br   secondly  if you  re expecting a film full of action and shocks  you won  t be disappointed . it doesn  t stand out above other movies  but it always keeps your attention .  br    br   thirdly  although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn  t wear off  but you  ll leave the cinema thinking  what was all the fuss about  .  br    br   i know this movie has a high rating  but it doesn  t add up . a  many of the reviews where written before the film was released and  b  the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal    of people rating the movie       with only   of people giving it      why such an enormous gap   
this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today . as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer  s or who are in the formative stages  i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease . the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle . casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line .  
i went into this film with expectations  from the hype  that it would be insightful and uplifting . certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band  wilco .   br    br   instead we get a lot of moping and whining about  the process   a dishonorable and no doubt one  sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer  songwriter  a gut  wrenching confession by the fallen member  s friend   for like   years   saying the  friendship had run its course   and this whiny  uncompelling story about how one record label  hurt their feelings  by dumping them  only so that the band could immediately get   offers from other labels  oh  the tension . . . not   they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain  but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn  t exist . this doesn  t even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline  insight or even a decent job at cinematography . the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch .  br    br   from the film  this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don  t have and think they  re some kind of guardians for the art of music  which they most definitely are not . and i thought the music sucked  and i couldn  t even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer .  br    br   i give it a     .  
i wasn  t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you  d expect to be living next door . they are ordinary flesh  and  blood people  not like the typical hollywood fare . they face an all too common problem   debilitating illness . but the story  line grips the heart with a powerful lesson . casting  script  direction  and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story . give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire .  
disjointed  unclear  bad screenplay  poor photography and direction . . . all in all very obviously an ill  conceived first effort at commercial film  making by the good people at tbn .  br    br   tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  china cry   the story of nora lam  to the big screen . but  the omega code  is an unfortunate miscue . as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved  china cry   i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone . they do much good with their ministry  but this isn  t an example of it . don  t waste your money . . . go rent  china cry  instead .  
lillian hellman  one of america  s most famous women playwrights  was a woman with a mission . her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country . in her memoir  she recounts her trip to the then  soviet union  as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system .  watch on the rhine  must have come as a result of those years . the left wing in america  as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism  not only in europe  but in japan as well .  br    br    watch on the rhine  was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese . in it ms . hellman was heralding america  s entrance in world war ii . the adaptation is credited to ms . hellman and dashiell hammett  her long time companion . as directed for the screen by herman shumlin  the film was well received when it premiered in     .  br    br   we are introduced to the muller family  when the film opens . they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico . they are to continue toward mrs . muller  s home in washington  d . c .  where her mother  fanny farrelly  is a minor celebrity hostess . the mullers  we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany . in fact  we thought  in a way  the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish  fleeing from a sure extermination .  br    br   we find out that mr . muller has had a terrible time in his native land  as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim . little does he know that he is coming to his mother  in  law  s house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy .  br    br   the film offers excellent acting all around . it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis  supporting role . paul lukas  repeating his broadway role  is quite convincing as kurt muller  the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family . mr . lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller  repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway .  br    br   the other best performance is by lucile watson  who plays fanny farrelly  the matriarch of this family . geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis  a guest of the farrellys  married to the contemptible teck de brancovis  a nazi sympathizer  played by george coulouris . beulah bondi  donald woods  and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr . shumlin .  br    br   the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule  no matter where .  
raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real . unfortunately  there is no reality to this film . the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake .  br    br   the reason  bad directing . peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal . it seems mr . sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel . wrong  it just gives it a badly  made feel . similarly  shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film  it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what  s on screen instead of enhance it .  br    br   of course  what  s on screen is so painfully fake  as if mr . sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look  hip  to his sundance buddies and show how  edgy  a filmmaker he is .  br    br   overall  the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr . sollett is . next time  how about taking a few writing and directing classes   
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption . i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family . well  acted and well  directed . if there were any flaws  i  d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again . what about all people of all cultural backgrounds  i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown  like in real life . nevertheless  the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker . loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes  
the idea had potential  but the movie was poorly scripted  poorly acted  poorly shot and poorly edited . there are lots of production flaws . . . for example  dr . lane  s daughter who never ages despite the passing years . wait for video  but don  t expect much .  
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie . it  s based on a novel of the same title  which was equally good  though different from the film . really made you think about how you  d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters . recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent  spouse  or family member   in other words  everyone   br    br   though the production isn  t quite hollywood quality   no big special effects   still  the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it . and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members  and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill .  br    br   you don  t want to miss this   
interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code . . . many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts . . . the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video  to be stocked besides the three  part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the   s . . dont remember it  you wont remember this one either in a year or two . this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls . . . very shameful . . . this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist  s son  you too can play high  roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money . . .  
i just watched this movie for the second time  and enjoyed it as much as the first time . it is a very emotional and beautiful movie  with good acting and great family values . inspiring and touching   
what was this about   pre  destination  you can not change the future cause it has already been written    br    br   i  ll give it this much . i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie . this movie took a concept and made it watchable .  br    br   if you  re looking for a recommendation  see it at matinee prices . no thrills but an interesting concept . they should have left the y  k reference out . . . .  
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film . yet  having read the content  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie . the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me . a vow to cherish is  without any doubt  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema . here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .  br    br   first  the entire content is particularly educational . it has something to offer to the modern audience  pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions . is there a need for christ in our times  does love still matter  what for is there faith  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life  is there really someone by my side i can always trust  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .  br    br   second  the movie is exceptionally humane . the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions . is it better for kyle david denman  and teri  megan paul  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home  is it better for john  ken howard  to leave ellen  barbara babcock   his sick wife  and start a new happy life with julia  donna bullock   a woman he falls in love with  in fact  ellen no longer recognizes him . . . yet  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity . had john  s rebellious brother  phil  d . david morin   better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life . phil  s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity . these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where  when or how they live .  br    br   third  the movie is a great portrayal of family  not very popular nowadays there are problems  yet  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together . this  something  is love and trust . i know that it may seem a bit idealistic . not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that . nevertheless  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .  br    br   fourth  the entire film focuses on people  s mutual help . if we want to live happy lives in our society  we must understand one thing we have to help one another . alexander  ossie davis  is an example of such attitude . at the beginning of the movie  we see him talk to john about praying . later  he helps his brother . alexander is a kinda  angel  that is sent to john and his family . isn  t it possible that we may become angels to one another   br    br   fifth  the artistic features are also worth attention . performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role  she does a perfect job . consider  for instance  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again . ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband . picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  autumn  while the sunshine  love  spreads everywhere . i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow  this can always be illuminated by light and joy . . .  br    br   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe . at the end  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do  br    br   kyle to his uncle phil yes  he  john brighton  lives according to the bible . but nobody forces you to do so . yet  according to what rules do you live   
this film had so much promise . i was very excited about this film . in the end  it was laughable at best  painful at worst . the acting styles ran the gamut from really  really  flat  the angels  the wife and daughter  to over  animated  casper  s character  . i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other . pay special attention to the scene regarding  the bug  . it  s pretty much an insult to the audience  s ability to figure things out . in defense of that scene  though  it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie . i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations . too bad they didn  t make use of it . i didn  t feel like i was transported to exotic locations . anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome . however  to end on a positive note  i thought the sets were pretty good . i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers . it is my opinion  and that  s all it is  that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased  this film would have been good .  
for all of you that don  t speak swedish the swedish original title of this film  rnarna  translates into something in the line of  the robbers  . this fact is the main problem i have with the film  cause it  s not really about the robbers at all . it  s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies . a regular desk job one would think  but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands  as the story goes  even shooting one of the robbers . . . exactly we  ve seen this before . the fact that there  s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn  t really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the film .  br    br   what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it  s masterfully executed in all ways  that the actors are as great as they are and don  t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story .  br    br   one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it  s music sets the right mood when it  s needed  but is absent for the rest of the time  which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car  chases spread throughout the film . a nice touch  the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he  s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background  but that  s something you have to neglect .  br    br   all in all it  s an entertaining film that steals more money in it  s plot than time from you .      
this movie is not based on the bible . it completely leaves christ out of the movie . they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ . let alone talk about it . it does not quote from scriptures . the end times are called the great tribulation . the movie does not even show bad times . the seven bowls  seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a   second news cast of the sea changing it  s structure . the anti  christ was killed     years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended . the only part they got correct was there was two prophets . the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures . the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie . i wanted to take unsaved people to it . i feel that the movie is evil . it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does . i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books .  br    br   the second problem with the movie is it was just bad . bad acting  bad special effects  bad plot and poor character development . i have seen better episodes of miami vice .  
even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera  work and his timing . this is a thin story   and quite predictable at times   but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately . the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that   the rich  prince  will lose his fortune .  br    br   nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it  s easy to get caught up in the clichs . then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living . the ending is very predictable but satisfying . i also want to compliment the title  writing very witty and fun .  
i truly wish i was not writing this review . i  m a christian  so i waited anxiously to see this movie . it seemed great   a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing  not that i buy the bible code itself   you can make it say anything you want . i do  however believe everything inside the bible  . so i  m sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews  when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes . i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater  i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes  i  m sure  . once the final credits began to roll  however  i could reflect . there were many parts of the movie i liked   some mostly unexpected plot twists  some effects that were indeed special  i  m not counting the visions . those were poorly done   and some interesting technical work   fades  sets  that type of thing . unfortunately  i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour  i could  ve gotten a better script . and the music was beyond cheesy  even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue  . so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater   like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was   but i  m not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it . i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies  and this just didn  t have either . i  m sorry  but i wouldn  t recommend this film to anyone . and that  s the tragedy . when will we see some intelligent christian fiction  it has to be out there somewhere . . .  
that certain thing is the story of a gold digger  viola dana  from a tenement house . her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers  but they are a loving family . although dana  s character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor  she refuses and holds out for a millionaire . everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy  but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire  son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain . the two marry hastily  but the girl  s dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger . however  she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own .  br    br   a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana  this film is a lot of fun . dana  s role is accessible  natural  and entertaining . she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama .  br    br   the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too . the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility . the title cards are also incredibly clever .  br    br   if you like films like my best girl  it  or the patsy  you will enjoy this film .  
the more i analyze this film  the worse it becomes . first of all  why a motivational speaker  that part was just stupid . i mean  why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker  is alexander stone really that disorganized  first he can  t decide what he wants to do to control the world  so he looks to the bible for ideas . many of these ideas  i might add  really have no reliability  for example  the part of the  the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror  could have already happened . it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something .  and gillen lane  s family  they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water  i might add that since casper van dien  gillen lane is only in his twenties  or that  s the impression that i had  and has a ten year child  he had his child during high school . yeah  there goes tbn  s family values . also  why did this film have to be so damn propaganda  like  i  ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said . the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated . this film doesn  t do that . the beginnig starts off well  with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy  s omega code . then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of  the two prophets tell him  tell your master that we are here   . dominic  ironsides  replies  he already knows  and points to a small surveillance camera . that part sent chills up my spine . had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film . i  ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character  as does michael ironsides . but the good guys are horrible . i  ve already went on about lane  s family  br    br   . now that i  m over the acting  i  ll get on to plot . this is obviously a baptist film  since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf . the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle  as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well  done . also another diatribe against the vatican  their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded  since gillen explains to the pope that it  s not the end of the world  but the beginning of a new one also  the vatican  or israelis  says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world . whoever it was  they wouldn  t just secede  they  d send over commandoes and kill them . this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying  we  re not going to talk to you any more   . come on  i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor . mediocre in short .  
but sadly due to rights issues  that almost certainly will never happen . transcripts of joe bob  s commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet  but they don  t quite capture his twang inflected delivery  which was a real hoot . nowadays  joe bob  real name john bloom  is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as  i spit on your grave   featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time   and jason x  one of the most reviled friday the   th sequels of all time  the series was never the same once it left paramount  . all i could think when they canceled it was  damn  where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping  blonde jokes  and horror trivia every saturday night  does this mean i have to get a life now   sadly  it does . but there  ll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for  monstervision .  long live the drive  in   
if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become  this one would take the prize . the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power  seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world . just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be   br    br   the acting was bad at best . casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film . michael york  s work was a fair match for the role  since he was the center of the film  and did a good job .  br    br   this plot was sickening and very disturbing . no tender or immature minds should see this film . this is how a basic good vs . evil plot can go astray .  br    br   there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles  who look for ways to market this type of junk . there must have been something censored out to get a pg    rating  but it was still awful .  
monstervision was a show i grew up with . from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one  the only  joe bob briggs . the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years  and provided some of the best drive  in memories to ever come outside of the drive  in .  br    br   without a doubt  the best late night television ever . if you didn  t stay up  you were missing out .  br    br   i know john bloom and joe bob live on  but i want them back where they belong . . . monstervision  question . . . did anyone else sit through all  hours of  the swarm   q   br    br   long live monstervision   
i didn  t know what to expect from the film . well  now i know . this was a truly awful film . the screenplay  directing and acting were equally bad . the story was silly and stupid . the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film  but he didn  t . i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad . where was the focus to the film  where was anything in this film  christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it . it was shabbily done and a waste of my money . do not see this film .  
i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in     . i was  at the time  and now at the age of   it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it . the    s all of a sudden seem so far away  what a great decade . anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time  as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films . it was like the    s version of chiller theater . if mst  k can get dvd  s why not joe bob  s show  at least monstervision was more interesting and informative . a lot of joe bob  s comments and info on the films were just hilarious . most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen . many were oddball flicks that you wouldn  t see anywhere else like the the japanese sci  fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell . with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors  i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up  since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show . i  m sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day  i guess will have to wait and see . until then  thats great television    
yes i admit i cried during this movie . it was so incredibly disappointing  that i couldn  t help myself but cry . tbn  trinity broadcasting network  has done it again . first with having the million dollar man  ex  professional wrestler  on their program  and now this .  br    br   the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies . it was quite amusing  yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate . the movie follows what is known as  the bible code  rather than following actual biblical scripture . this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting . its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie . it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie .  br    br   i highly recommend you do not watch this movie  even if your life depended on it .  
probably my all  time favorite movie  a story of selflessness  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause  but it  s not preachy or boring . it just never gets old  despite my having seen it some   or more times in the last   years . paul lukas  performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight . the kids are  as grandma says  more like  dressed  up midgets  than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mother  s slow awakening to what  s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs  they  d all be  up  for this movie .  
 . . . . this movie basks too much in its own innocence . it doesn  t tell a story it  s more a big time snooze fest . while the actors are all personable  the story is so trite and goes nowhere . i think victor rasuk has great charisma  but deserves a real film from a real storyteller .  
i  ll tell you a tale of the summer of     . a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie  and it was a who  s who of the top canadian bands of the age . we got there about  am  waited in line most of the morning  and when the doors opened at  am  we were among the first inside the gates . we then waited and waited in the hot sun  slowly broiling but we didn  t care  because the headliners were among our favourites . at one point  early in the afternoon  i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier . i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t  shirt . this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day . there  s nothing reasonable  nor taste  determined  nor really anything except their fandom . snotty of me  isn  t it  so  i  in my hatred of the band  have denied myself the delight that is whale music .  br    br   desmond howl had it all . it  s hard to say what he  s lost  since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains  the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking  . the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams  phantoms  and his own past  until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in . . . and  trite as it sounds  breaks him out .  br    br   canadian cinema suffers from several problems . generally  a lack of money  as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help  as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian  leads to lower production values than american or british films  and most people don  t like to watch anything that sounds or looks like  well  not like an american film . next  canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story  and tell it well . third  they seem to think that gratuitous nudity  often full  frontal  makes something artistic . i  m sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies  especially late at night on the cbc  knows exactly what i  m talking about . it  s almost like a  don  t do this  handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film  makers threw it out a long time ago .  br    br   in the   s and   s  however  some films  such as bruce mcdonald  s work and the brilliant c . r . a . z . y .  have broken this mold  and managed to maintain what makes them canadian  while holding onto watchable production values and great stories . whale music is such a film  on the surface . deeper than just its canadian  isms  it  s a deeply moving story of a man who  s lost his grip  through grief and excess  who is redeemed by music then by love . and that redeems even the rheostatics .    
what else is left to say   br    br   i  ve read all the reviews here and most are right on . . however  one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it  or something along those lines  . evil   wow  what a shocker . . i mean  tbn basically made this film . open your eyes please .  br    br   anway  this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years .  br    br   the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it . if this movie can be made  there are no limits  and therefore  we have no choice but to get ready for  yentl    and  ernest loses the omega codes .   br    br   for those of you who are into the biblical stories  the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started .  
i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business . . . who are now still trying to become adults . . . . no more fans  groupies  money etc . . . and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life . . . as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight . . . it is almost like they have to begin anew . . . this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the    s and    s are going through now . . . . and that  s where i find the film sad and depressing . but it portrays the life of an old rock star  abandoned and lost  in a believable way . the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  outrageous  . . . and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . this film is a must have for folks in their    s who have seen the rise and fall of bands  people who knew the members  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in  and popularity fades . this is an almost perfect movie . . . . sad but in a way positive . . . . because of the whales . a must see   
quite honestly  the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time . during the first   minutes i sat stunned in my seat  trying to decide if i should demand a refund . but since i hadn  t paid to see it in the first place  passes   i figured i might as well stay . and i didn  t think it could possibly get any worse .  br    br   it did . i will quickly run through the low points  includes some spoilers   the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane  a motivational speaker with two phds . the characterization was inconsistent for example  lane  despite his credentials  is a complete nitwit . then there  s the lame  o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code . also  terrible  action  sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation  and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger  it turns out to be a dream sequence  that  s cute for grammar school writing assignments  but it  s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture . the pacing was bad after a long opener  the first third of the movie changes scenes every   seconds . later  the pacing improves  but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around . and as someone else mentioned  years pass yet no one  not even lane  s young daughter  ages . that was disconcerting .  br    br   there are a few good things  though . the quality of the film  e . g . lack of graininess  is high and very attractive . the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism . also  there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god  finally  to help him  this proved to be quite exhilarating  even to me  someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior . but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie . unfortunately  it was followed by major incomprehensibility .  br    br   the characters  dialogue  direction and acting were all poorly done . michael ironside had nothing to do  and michael york was just weird . i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused  and the characterization more fleshed out  the film would have been far better .  br    br   in a nutshell  the omega code disappoints . definitely do not pay to see this . i give it  out of ten stars .  br    br    
anyone who loves the rheostatics  music is going to enjoy this film . i have some minor complaints  mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors  not maury  who aren  t really convincing in their roles  but i don  t have time write a detailed review . i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader  s digest version of whale music    don  t watch it . it cuts out entire scenes and subplots  if you can them that  from the film . the cbc  which presents most of films untouched  took half the guts out of whale music . i don  t know why . it  s horrible what they did to the film . rent the video or watch it in a theatre  but don  t watch it on cbc television .  
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character . words cannot describe  nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was . but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting  terrible dialog  corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force  fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network . its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep  religious message attached to it . they failed miserably . it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time .  
i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie . for some reason it clicked on all my levels  tensions in a family  loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with . it didn  t hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire  cyndy preston  . i also bought the sound track to this movie  very hard to get  . loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv  
i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about   people . we all expected a good piece of christian film  making . what we got was an excruciatingly painful  drawn  out  and pretty boring attempt at a film . it has good looking production values but also has poor acting  a weak script with lousy dialogue  and no real sense of direction . from the first   minutes we all knew it would be a long night . we all hated it  and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than  anaconda .  none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than  hours . flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can  t save this bad  bad movie . i  d give it a  out of    and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable  movie  werewolf       the night before i saw this movie .  
i was amazingly impressed by this movie . it contained fundamental elements of depression  grief  loneliness  despair  hope  dreams and companionship . it wasn  t merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music . he finds a companion who comes with her own issues . claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst .  br    br   des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star . yet he has musical genius . he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate  while things around him literally go to ruins . his focus is creating his whale music  in fact it becomes an obsession for him .  br    br   claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay . she finds hidden talents while being in des company . she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her . she learns to trust him over a period of time .  br    br   these two find love with one another . not the mind blowing  sex infused kind of passion  but a love where friendship and understanding means more . for two people who have been hurt  they find trust together .  
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . there was a bit  but precious little  of good acting  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg  who only appeared once and had no lines . otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . the plot line was rather weak  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation . certainly not one of the year  s best .  
a friend of mine recommended this movie  citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl  the movie  s main character . i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more  i  m not very sure whether or not that  s flattering portrayal .  br    br   this is a pretty unique work  the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance  not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue  whale music is just so much more  well  relaxed .  but instead that they both represent modern love stories .  br    br   in general i  m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians  for example i highly recommend hard core logo  and this film in particular . it has an innocent charm  des is not always the most likeably guy  but there  s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy .  
i am a youth pastor  s wife and we took some youth to see this film . we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them . they didn  t get it and i didn  t enjoy it . it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world  the bible code  the torah code and the code in the koran  and is so questionable as to be laughable . this is not a step forward for christians in the arts  it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door .  
my first exposure to  whale music  was the rheostatics album of the same name  that i bought around     . i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album  which remains in a prominent place in my collection  was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington  s book .  br    br   i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it  an amazing read  i have since re  read the book numerous times  each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music .  br    br   i found the film in      on video . i haven  t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film  but this one worked for me . the role of claire could have been cast differently  but overall i think that paul quarrington  s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen .  br    br   maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius . the movie deals with family relationships  love  and finding someone who understands . i would strongly recommend  whale music  to not only music fans  but anyone who has ever lost something or someone  and tried to find their way back to the world .  
i  m a christian . i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians  however . as a rule  they are  know  nothings  when it comes to movie production . i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . however  they did a hideous job of it . the acting was horrible  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across . not only was the movie terribly made  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . however  in this  critique   those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . in short  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  and i would not recommend it to anyone  except for comic relief from the every day grind .  
walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema . how do you get laughs out of other people  s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long   br    br   well  this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs  beautiful scenery  and quite a good buzz as well . i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it  and marijuana illegal  since  those other races  used it . . . undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world .  br    br   an extraordinary  dvd extra  commentary . . . two of them in fact . . . run thru the whole movie with both the actors  and then again with the writers . i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie  but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take . what a hoot  don  t miss it      stars  
  br    br   i would highly recommend seeing this movie . after viewing it  you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying  at least it wasn  t the omega code .   br    br   forget my money  i want my time back   
  br    br   this is definitely a  must see  for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide  out  trying to avoid being caught by parents  teachers  the police  etc . . . the protagonist is a lady in her forties  living in her mansion  breeding orchids  and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so  called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her . when he all of the sudden dies  she is confronted with the truth . the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt . she doesn  t know what to do  until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain . she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead . . . the story is quite original  the performances outstanding  i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one . still  the melodramatic touch is present . the film is typical british the jokes aren  t vulgar  there is no violence involved . it shouldn  t be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching  saving grace  . it will be so much more fun  especially the scene with the  old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious . i thought my jawbones would burst .      
i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry . the first   minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society  men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do  the movie falls . becoming boring and not funny at all . they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable . i didn  t like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either . i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed .  br    br   i don  t recommend this movie .  
this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist  and am i glad he did  the blend of british humor  should i say  humour   and the reality of a lost  middle  aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot . add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot  those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received   and it is a truly hilarious  yet touching film . i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights  maybe it  s just my mendocino county blood  but the brits definitely got this one right         
i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons . for the first half hour it  s actually pretty decent . although the acting isn  t any better then that which you would find in a rap video  its kinda funny and the production value doesn  t seem half bad . in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao  another recent dominican film  which turned out to be much much better than i expected . the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole  which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic . unfortunately i don  t think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter  and they f  ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them . about   minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits . not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge  space age  cgi effects dating to what i  m guessing would be the    s  but the whole plot just goes down the drain . the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations  and clever one liners . to top it all off  and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert  it all turns out to be a dream . oh my who didn  t see that coming  oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie . well after about an hour into it i start thinking  hmmmm something just doesn  t seem right about the sound track but what can it be    and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter   .  br    br   when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art     perhaps a comedy to match france  s amelie  or an action flick to match thailand  s ong  bak  an animation as akira was to japan  a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england  or a socio  awakening journey as waking life had here in the states .  br    br   . . . i would give it a  but i  ve seen much worse come out of dr  search los jodedores and you  ll know what i  m talking about .  
it may  or may not  be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca       role for the best actor oscar .  i still would have given the oscar to bogie  but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination  at least .  well  i  m glad i did check this movie out  because i enjoyed it immensely . i think the movie did preach a little  but not only did i not mind  i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them .  br    br   the acting was outstanding in this movie . i especially enjoyed paul lukas  lucile watson  rightfully nominated for an oscar   bette davis  wrongfully not nominated   george coulouris and  oddly  eric roberts  who plays the middle child . i really enjoyed his character an odd  looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher . he just cracks me up . even the characters name  bodo  is funny .  br    br   the ending  in which lukas  s character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons  worked for me as well . i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did  and i understood why he couldn  t quite explain it . the message this movie makes is a good and noble one  the scenery  meaning the house  is beautiful  and the acting is the excellent . watch this movie if you ever get a chance .  br    br        
someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo  gritty look is somehow seen as  realistic  by some people .  br    br   i didn  t see anything realistic about the characters  although the actors did their best with really bad parts  or the situations . instead  i saw a forced  self  conscious effort at being  edgy    gritty  and  down and dirty  .  br    br   sadly  it takes a lot more than hand  holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way .  br    br   it  s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies  with bad cinematography  non  existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as  art  .  br    br   it  s little wonder that films like  in the bedroom  or  about schmidt  get such raves . i found them to be meandering and very average  but compared to the current slew of independent clones like  raising victor vargas  they are outright brilliant and inspired .  br    br   a few years ago seeing an  independent  film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care  and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets  nowadays  it means that chances are you  ll get yet another by  the  numbers  let  s  shake  the  camera  around  for  two  hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors . and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived .  br    br   is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies  not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them .  
this is an hilarious movie . one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor . from the largest role to the smallest  each character is vivid  unforgettable and so understandable . it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve .  
it has a great name  but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money  in fact the first      mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone .  br    br   and yet the producers  roberto angel salcedo  calls him an actor  but i don  t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting   . . . . period . the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing .  br    br   for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it  but they didn  t   and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad  i don  t buy it .  br    br   but hopefully this is as bad as it gets . to make people accept those dvd  s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it  that might work out .  br    br   maka  
a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother   saving grace  seems cut from the same cloth as a half  dozen other british comedies over the past two years . . . underdog is faced with adversity  finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him  herself in the process .  br    br   widowed and thus broke  grace is a master gardener  and is enlisted to help her friend  employee matthew grow his pot plant . he  s been doing it all wrong  so grace helps him out . they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot  which they can both benefit from . he enjoys smoking  she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage .  br    br   highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise  dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in  saturday night fever  and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb .  br    br   blethyn is always watchable  and you can  t say that about a lot of people . . well  i can  t  anyway . ferguson is very good  and tcheky karyo  who i liked in  la femme nikita   is memorable .  br    br   not profoundly moving or insightful  but immensely entertaining  and at a brisk   minutes  feels like a walk with friends .     .  
the film is poorly casted  except for some familiar old hollywood names . other performances by unknown names  i . e .  jennifer gabrielle  are uninspiring . i have seen other films by this director  unfortunately this is one of his worst . perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay   br    br   in a positive note  kim bassinger  s and pat morita  s performance saved the movie from oblivion . i enjoyed pat more in karate kid  though . there are many good movies to see  and in short  this one is not one of them . save your money and the celluloid .  br    br   jason vanness  
i love this film . it  s one of those i can watch again and again . it is acted well by a good cast that doesn  t try too hard to be star studded .  br    br   the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller . either would have killed the film completely .  br    br   the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel  good factor throughout .  br    br   it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes . . .  no that  s not a spoiler    
one of the worst films i have ever seen . how to define  worst   i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again . somehow  one  hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans  mary kay saleswomen  las vegas  gays  fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy  sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed . how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be  the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one  is beyond me . the worst part of this mess  and that takes some work  is the mangled script in      elvis  words and songs that he would speak  perform in the      s are quoted  worst special effect  that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis  grave  potentially the most photographed  recognizable grave in the world  resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere . potentially  this film  s biggest audience would be elvis fans . however  the rampant stupidity  nixon gave elvis a dea badge  not fbi credentials . . . and i could go on and on  actually undercuts that conventional wisdom . ugh . i used the word  wisdom  to describe this stupid movie . this is truly a horrible  horrible film .  
yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award  material
