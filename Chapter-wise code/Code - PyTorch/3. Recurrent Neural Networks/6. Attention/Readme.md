# Attention

## Sequence to Sequence Models (RNNs)

In order to better understand RNNs, let us take a look at an example of a machine translation model. Here the model has 2 parts : Encoder and Decoder.



## Applications of Attention

1. Machine translation
2. Document Summarization
3. Dailgoue Exchange
4. Image Caption Generator
