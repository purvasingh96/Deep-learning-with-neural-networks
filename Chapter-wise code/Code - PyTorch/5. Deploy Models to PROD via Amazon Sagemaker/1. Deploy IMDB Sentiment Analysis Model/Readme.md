## General Outline

Typically, when using a notebook instance with SageMaker, you will proceed through the following steps. Of course, not every step will need to be done with each project. Also, there is quite a lot of room for variation in many of the steps, as you will see throughout these lessons.

1. Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
2. Process / Prepare the data.
3. Upload the processed data to S3.
4. Train a chosen model.
5. Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
6. Deploy the trained model.
7. Use the deployed model.
