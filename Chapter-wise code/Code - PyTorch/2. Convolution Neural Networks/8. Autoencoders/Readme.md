# Autoencoders

## Overview
Autoencoders are neural network that is trained to attemp to copy its input
to its output. <br>
The network may be viewed as consisting of two parts: an
encoder function h = f (x) and a decoder that produces a reconstruction r = g(h).
<br><br>
Key component of an autoencoder is its ability to compress such that image data is still retained.
