# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional networks also known as convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are a specialized kind of neural network for **processing data that has a known grid-like topology.**

# Convolution Operation
The convolution operates on the **input** with a **kernel (weights)** to produce an **output map** given by:<br>

* **1-D** discrete convolution operation can be given by:<br>

* **2-D** discrete convolution operation can be given by:<br>

## Properties of Convolution Operation and Cross-Correlation
### Commutative Property
* Convolution operation is **commutatiive**.
* Commutative property arises because we have **ï¬‚ipped the kernel** relative to the input<br>

### Cross-Correlation 
* Function which is analogous to convolution operation without flipping the kernel is called **cross-correlation operation.**
* Cross-correlation is **not commutative.**<br>
* **Convolution operation:**<br>

* **Correlation operation:**<br>

## Toeplitz Matrix
* **1D** convolution operation can be represented as a **matrix vector product.** 
* The kernel marix is obtained by composing weights into a **Toeplitz matrix.**
* Toeplitz matrix has the property that **values along all diagonals are constant.**<br>

## Block-Circulant and Doubly-Block-Circulant Matrix
* To **extend** the concept of Toeplitz matrix towards **2-D input**, we need to **convert 2-D input to 1-D vector.**
* **Kernel needs to be modified** as before but this time resulting in a **block-circulant matrix.**
* A **circulant matrix** is a special case of a **Toeplitz matrix** where each **row is equal to the row above shifted by one element.**<br>

* A matrix which is **circulant with respect to its sub-matrices** is called a **block circulant matrix.**<br>

* If each of the **submatrices is itself circulant**, the matrix is called **doubly block-circulant matrix.**<br>
