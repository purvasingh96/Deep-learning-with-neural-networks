# Machine Learning Basics 
Machine learning isessentially a form of applied statistics with increased emphasis on the use ofcomputers to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreased emphasison proving conÔ¨Ådence intervals around these functions

# Learning Algorithms
A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some class of **tasks T** and **performance measure P**, if its **performance** at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.<br>

| **Task, T**                | ML tasks are described in terms of how **ML system should process an example**.<br> **Example** is collection of **features** , quantitatively measured from event that ML model will process.<br> 1. **Classification**-which of the *k* categories, input belongs to?<br> 2. **Classification with missing inputs** - ML model defines *single function mapping* from vector to categorical input.<br> 3. **Regression** - Predict output, given some input.   |
| **Perfomance Pressure, P** | 1. Measure *accuracy, error-rate* of model.<br> 2. Evaluate P, using *test-set* (completely separate from *train-set*).<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Experience, E**          | 1. Based on E, ML algorithms are classified as *unsupervised* and *supervised* learning algos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
