# Machine Learning Basics 
Machine learning isessentially a form of applied statistics with increased emphasis on the use ofcomputers to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreased emphasison proving conÔ¨Ådence intervals around these functions

# Learning Algorithms
A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to someclass of **tasks T** and **performance measure P**, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
