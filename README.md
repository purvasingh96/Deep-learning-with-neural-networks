# Overview 
Basic idea of an Artifical Neural Network is to mimic a biological neuron with axons, dendrites, nucleus etc.
For a simple neural network, you would need 2 neurons, who pass on information using **Synapse**, flowing from **dendrite** of sending neuron to **terminal axon** of recieving neuron.
