# Repository Content: Projects and Theorey List

Over the course of time, I have enrolled in multiple MOOCs and read multiple books related to Deep Learning. I try to document all the important notes in one place so that it is easy for me to revise ðŸ˜Š. <br>

Below are the list of projects/theorey that I have worked on/documented. Please see the **Project List** for the code and refer the **Theorey List** for the detailed explaination of various concepts.:
